# 🧠 ai4org – GAN-based Hallucination Mitigation for Local Private LLMs

**ai4org** is a locally run, privacy-first framework that uses a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** approach to **detect and reduce hallucinations** in custom Large Language Models (LLMs). Designed for organizations deploying their own LLMs on-premises, **ai4org** improves factual reliability while ensuring **zero data leakage**.

> ⚡ Your data. Your model. **No cloud involved.**
> 🤖 Powered by GANs: Generator = LLM, Discriminator = Truth Checker.

## 🌟 Key Features

* 🛡️ **Privacy-Preserving**: Everything runs locally — no API calls or external data sharing.
* 🧠 **GAN Architecture**: A discriminator challenges the LLM's outputs to reduce hallucinations over time.
* 🔁 **Feedback Loop**: The system fine-tunes itself based on discriminator rejection or optional human feedback.
* 🎯 **Domain-Specific**: Train on your organization’s internal data for maximum relevance and accuracy.
* 🧩 **Modular Design**: Works with most Hugging Face-compatible LLMs (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.).

## 🔬 How It Works

At its core, **ai4org** functions like a GAN:

* **Generator**: A fine-tuned LLM that produces text based on organizational inputs.
* **Discriminator**: A binary classifier that detects hallucinations or factually incorrect content.
* **Training Loop**: If the discriminator flags the output, the generator is refined with new feedback (auto or manual).

## 🛠️ Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai4org.git
cd ai4org
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the system:**

```bash
python main.py
```

> ✅ *Make sure your local LLM weights are available. No external API required.*

## 📈 Roadmap

* [x] Local fine-tuning with organization-specific data
* [x] GAN-based feedback architecture
* [x] Discriminator training loop
* [ ] Plug-and-play human-in-the-loop support
* [ ] UI for real-time review and validation
* [ ] Metrics dashboard for hallucination reduction tracking

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> A private healthcare organization fine-tunes an LLM on its medical documentation.
> The LLM outputs a treatment suggestion.
> The **discriminator flags the suggestion as inconsistent** with training data.
> The LLM is penalized and retrained — improving future outputs.
