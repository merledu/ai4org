2.0 – December 2010). The B ranch Operation s Manual was last updated in December 2007 and since then various policies and procedural instructions, having impact on branch banking operations, have been issued. Hence, it was necessary to update the existing version of the Manual and incorporate all substantial changes. Resultantly, the Manua l has undergone significant revision through reorganizing the structure of the previous version, updating all material and increasing the coverage of critical subject matter . The primary audience of this Manual is i ndividuals involved in the management & performance of branch banking operations and related activities , Compliance & Controls Group and Audit & Risk Assets Review Group. The Manual covers regulatory requirements, policies and procedural instructions relevant to branch banking operations. Howev er, the users of the Manual, for better understanding, are recommended to read it in overall context of relevant policies approved by the Board, Application User Manuals and other documents such as the Accounting Manual etc. The actions of this audience must be in line with the policies and procedures stated in the Manual. Any un - authorized deviation can result in disciplinary action being initiated against the concerned individual (s) depending upon the ser iousness of the action . Branches, in particular, a re expected to follow the instructions laid down in this manual for achieving business objectives and maintaining effective control environment. This will improve their operations and also help them achieve complian ce with regulatory requirements and bette r audit rating. The Content of the Manual is classified into various sections based on broader categori es of banking operations and is further split into different chapters. The Section Summaries on the Section header pages spell out the content of the se ction for users’ benefit. Efforts have been made to organize each chapter so that the coverage is more thorough on all aspects, emphasizing the critical regulatory /policy requirements on one hand, whilst aided by detailed process flows on the other hand. P rocess flows are carefully included in a sequential manner and have been simplified without compromising the quality of substance and objectivity. B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 12 Besides procedural instructions to perform various operations, in this version, the branches and supervisory staff have also been facilitated with provision of various tools to monitor their financial transactions and non- financial operational activities t o strengthen the control environment. Another emphasis in this version is to supplement the process flows with steps for usage of Symbols application. The Bank has undertaken approach of centralization of business processes with an objective of improved co ntrols and process efficiency. To date, various processes have b een centralized that also a ffect branch operations and processes. These processes have been included in the Manual, specifically, highlighting the functions to be performed by the branches wit h their respective responsibilities. The instructions of the Manual, since its issuance, may be further revised, amended, modified or overridden through subsequent issuance of policies and circulars, hence, the users are instructed to conform to those policies and ci rculars and use them as addenda to the Manual. In this regard, whenever a change of a permanent nature is made to any operational policies and/or procedures, a new circular will be issued by giving reference to the particular Chapter / Section / Subsection of the Manual. To update the Manual was a huge exercise and could not be possible without active participation of resources across the Bank. We would like to thank various groups involved in providing v alued feedback and suggestions includin g Commercial Branch Banking, Islamic Banking, Consumer Banking, Compliance & Controls, Financial Control, Risk Management, Information Technology and Audit & Risk Assets Review. Finally, we would like to appreciate Business Process Management Division who led this critical assignment in collaboration with other Divisions of Operations Group.

Cheques may only be accepted as part of Account activation deposit in case of undoubted parties and on the personal responsibility of Branch Managers. In all such cases, the cheque must be crossed by the customer before being lodged for clearing / collecti on. If cheque is deposited before the account number is generated it will be kept in safe custody under dual control. In case the cheque is returned unpaid it is the responsibility of the Branch Manager to re -conduct the KYC and ensure activation deposit i s made in the account. Above requirement applies across the board unless approved otherwise by the competent authority in the Product Program for specific products 1.4 COMPUTERIZED NATIONA L IDENTIFICA TION CARD (CNIC) /ONLINE VERIFICATION / VALIDATION i. Valid CN IC of the customer and its on -line verification from NADRA’s VeriSys system is one of the prerequisite for new account opening and must be strictly followed. To evidence that the verification of CNIC was performed branches are required to print copies of c ustomer’s CNIC from VeriSys system and retain the same with account opening forms. Ensure CNIC verification through NADRA Online VeriSys BEFORE opening of account/ establishment of any relationship. ii. In case where the customer do not have a ‘valid’ CNIC the bank may open the account on the basis of expired CNIC and a receipt issued by NADRA evidencing that customer has applied for renewal of his CNIC along with an undertaking in writing stating that the valid CNIC will be submitted within 15 days of the issu ance of CNI C as evidenced by the receipt. Further, in case of ‘registered aliens’ who wish to open a bank account in Pakistan in Pak Rupee, the bank may accept a copy of valid ‘Alien Registration Card’ issued by National Aliens Registration Authority (NARA ) instead of CNIC. Likewise, bank may also accept copy of National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistani (NICOP) & Pakistan Origin Card (POC) issued by NADRA in lieu of CNIC for opening of account in Pak Rupee or Foreign Currency (same verification process applies as for CNIC). Proof of Registration (PoR) issued by NADRA to Afghan Refugees is not acceptable for opening of account. Note: if the account is Opened with expired CNIC and hence on basis of receipt issued by NADRA, it is prime responsibility of the Branch Manager/ Operations Manager to keep close liaison with the customer and update the CNIC number in the system/ bank records as soon as the customer gets his new CNIC. In -case the customer is unable to furnish the same within 30 days , BM/ BOM should immediately block the account for any further withdrawal activities (irrespective of the mode of payment) and mark restraint type ‘STW’ to the account . iii. While opening the account Authori zed Officer should check that customer address provided on Account Opening Form (AOF) is the same as given on CNIC. In case the address given on AOF is different from the one given on CNIC, proper justification /documentary evidence should be obtained from the customer. Documentary evidence could be a copy of the Utility bill OR Original Registration of the new residence . In case of rental residence, lease / tenancy agreement OR a letter from the landlord along with Landlord NIC/ Utility bill stating that t he person wishes to open the account lives in his or her property as a tenant etc. B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 50 iv. Branches will not recover “CNIC verification charges” from their accountholders and/or prospective customers. The verification of CNIC is not a direct service to the customers rather it is an effort of the bank towards mitigation of its own risk. v. All the documents mentione d above MUST be seen in original by an authorized officer of the bank. After seeing the original documents the authorized officer will affix a rubber stamp on its copies saying “Original seen & copy attested” along with AS/IBS number under his/her si gnatur e/stamp. vi. While opening the account Authorized Officer should check that customer Signature provided on Account Opening Form (AOF) is the same as per CNIC. Incase Signatures differ; an undertaking of the fact mus t be obtained from the customer as per Annexure XXII Note: NADRA Verification facility is meant to be used strictly for bank’s internal operations / purpose as prescribed by the bank / regulations it should not be used for any other purposes and any such verification pri nt out to remain with banks record. In case of misuse it is a clear violation of VeriSys service agreement with NADRA. Guidelines for E xisting Customers with In-Valid NIC: SBP had given the final opportunity to banks for regularizing accounts without CNIC up to Dec 31, 2009 . Upon expiry of this deadline bank is required to adopt the following procedure : (BPRD Circular letter No. 30 of 2009)  Inform its customers through print a nd electronic media that upon expiry of extended deadline of Dec 31, 2009 accounts without CNIC will be blocked for all debit transactions/ withdrawals, irrespective of mode of payment until subject regulatory requirement is fulfilled.  Debit block option s hould be exercised after one month prior notice is served upon to such customers who have not submitted copies of their CNICs.

This change in the policy is based on the fact that NADRA has provided a relaxation to the senior citizens from renewing their CNICs after attai ning the age of 65 years or above. (Refer SBP circular BPRD/BLRD -09/2009 -3857 dated June 09, 2009). 1.7 OPENING OF CONSUMER CUSTOMER’S COLLECTIO N ACCOUNT (CCA) i.

By identifying customers effectively, you are able to deal with them in the appropriate manner and comfortably. 2- Customer Acceptance: The point at which a new customer is accepted or rejected is the easiest point at which the risk of dealing with illegal money can be avoided. By following good customer acceptance policies, you can avoid dealing with entities and individuals who might en gage in illegal transactions. 3- Accounts & Transactions Monitoring: In an effective CDD / KYC policy, customer accounts and transactions are properly classified in terms of risk and are regularly monitored. Through checks and thresholds, unusual activiti es or activities by high -risk customers are detected and reviewed. 4- Risk Management: To ensure that the risks posed by money laundering / terrorist financing and other criminal customer activities are consistently dealt with, good risk management practi ces are essential. In this way the Bank can 'scale' its operations by remaining vigilant about customer -driven risk. 2.2 CDD/ KYC POLICY The general misperception of Branch Managers on Customer Due Diligence (CDD) / KYC / AML policy is that SBP regulations m ake the new account opening difficult. On the contrary, proper account documentation and CDD / KYC procedures provide satisfaction and protection to the Branch Managers / staff against unforeseen events and assist in establishing relationship in accordance with the bank’s policies. Getting maximum reliable information about the customer is the basic principle of good banking which enables the Bank to make correct decisions to meet with customer’s genuine banking requirements promptly. Branch officers / staf f must ensure that all the necessary documents have been obtained at the time of account opening or at the time of ongoing reviews of CDD / KYC formalities. The Bank has a statutory obligation to know its customers (which includes Customer Identification ( CI), Customer Acceptance (CA), Assigned Risk Rating (Normal or High) and subsequent monitoring of transactions). It is also obligatory to understand the nature of the business to be conducted with us, beneficial ownership(s) and 3rd party mandates. This ap plies to all type of customers regardless of who they are, their personal status (For PEPs see Section 4.12 of CDD -AML -Handbook), or the type of account or service that they require. Knowing your customer means: i. Seeking evidence of identity and address an d independently confirming that evidence at the start of a business relationship with the Bank. ii. Seeking information regarding the nature of the business that the customer expects to conduct with the Bank, establishing sources of income and expected patter ns of transactions, and keeping that B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 56 information up to date, to show what might be regarded as normal activity for that customer. iii. All resident prospective customers for accounts with MCB must be seen face to face except those customers who are living abroa d and wants to open a non -face -to-face/on -line account; adequate measures in this regard should be taken, for example, independent verification by a reliable 3rd party, client report from the previous bank / DFI of the customer, etc. Branch Manager: Will b e responsible for reviewing all HR Accounts once in a year and NR accounts once in three years. 2.3 COMPLETION OF ACCOUN T OPENING & KNOW YOU R CUSTOMER FORMS All prospective customers must completely fill -in all the appropriate columns of Account Opening Form (AOF) and provide the necessary documentary evidence of identity and financial information. If any column on AOF is not applicable it should be stroked ou t as “N/A”; and no section should be left blank. The customer must be interviewed by the Branch Manager (BM) and he MUST sign the KYC Form. (In the absence of Branch Manager BOM may interview and sign the KYC Form which at a later stage MUST be ratified and signed by the Branch Manager). Having completed the CDD/KYC requirements the AOF be handed over to Branch Operations Manager (BOM). Branch Operations Manager (BOM) must sign the AOF in order to keep intact the maker - checker policy of the Bank. The details of the AOF must invariably be input in the system by the BOM. The system generated report after this input MUST be checked by the BM. i. Any additional information obtained during the interview about the customer’s background, country of origin, public or hi gh profile position (PEP), nature of business and financial standing should be recorded by the branch manager and kept in customer’s file. ii. No account will be opened until the Account Opening & Know Your Customer Forms have been completed and all documents have been received and examined to ensure that they are valid. 2.4 THRESHOLD LIMITS All transactions across accounts, above the following specified financial thresholds, will be reviewed and signed off as being in line with CDD / KYC information retrospect ively by the respective Branch Managers . System generated reports will be produced for accounts with a debit or credit transactions or turnover above the following threshold limits: High Value Transactions Limit PKR 1,000,000 and above Personal and Business Accounts : Thresholds will be input into the system as per the account holder’s profile. For Sole Traders / Partnership accounts branch managers will decide the expected debit and credit turnover in the account after a thorough interview with the p rospective customer, and in case of personal accounts, individual’s monthly income / salary will be input as threshold limits in the system. Corporate Accounts & All Other Accounts : In line with the financials or expected turnovers in corporate accounts, Branch Managers / Regional Head will decide the respective parameters to be used as threshold limits for accounts falling into this category. B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 57 The above limit has been put in place to monitor the accounts’ activities and by no means suggest that any transac tion exceeding the limits will constitute a “Suspicious Transaction”. Branch managers should use their judgment when they review such transactions and must refer to their respective RH / GMs or Business Heads when in doubt. 2.5 EXCEPTION REPORTS Income / Sal ary / Turnover Exceptions Report This report shows all the accounts where income/salary or Dr/Cr Turnover exceeds the financial profile set in the account. This report will be basic tool for monitoring KYC. The parameters will be updated as and when the KY C is updated as per the CDD / EDD criteria of the Bank. High Value Transactions Report In order to monitor the exceptions, the above report is generated by Knowledge Manager (KM) and forwarded to respective branches on very next day; which will be a vital tool for monitoring customer transactions: i. This report will include the high value cash transaction over the counter for PKR 1,000,000 /- and above as well. Responsibility of the Branch Manager i. Will be to review these reports and take actions where neces sary and update KYC as per CDD / EDD procedures as well as make notation on the above mentioned reports as to what action has been taken. These reports will be checked /audited by the respective RCO during the visit of the branch. ii. Any change in client’s pr ofile (change in turnover) already established in the record/system must be supported by source document.

According to rules profit on PLS TDRs irrespective of its maturing date is paid twice in a calendar year. Such payments are to be treated as interim payments and Zakat @ 2.5% from such assets which existed on the valuation dates should be deducted on the face value of the asset only once in each Zakat Year at the time of disbursement of first pr ofit. It may also happen that there may not be sufficient amount of profit available then in such cases the remaining amount of Z akat, should be recovered at the time of disbursement of second profit. The reporting of such assets should be shown under asset code 103 in the reporting form CZ -07. ii. For assets belonging to this category where return becomes receivable by the asset holders on a certain date in a Zakat year, but is not collected by him, Zakat shall be deducted for each Zakat year involved of i f the return had been collected by the asset holder when receivable by him. iii. The amount of Zakat deducted will be entered date -wise in the relevant folio of the “ Zakat Deduction/Refund Register for Assets Other than Savings::(CZ -02). iv.

Zakat Amount will be deducted at the 1st profit payment or maturity whichever comes first after the 1st of Rama dan. The calculation for deduction of Zakat will be as follows:  Profit to be paid – Zakat Amount – WHT  With -holding tax will be levied on the profit left after the deduction of Zakat amount.

The respective Short Term Deposit shall also be endorsed accordingly so that the amount of Zakat Unreali zed is recovered at the time of payment of subsequent return(s) or payment of maturity/encashment value, whichever be earlier.

Teller views the screen of Teller Totals BT  Totals  Teller Totals . This will ensure that Teller has totaled his/ her own TIL. ii. Teller generates following reports to validate daily postings :  For Current/Saving transactions: EOC  Reports  Daily transaction by branch/officer  For GL transactions: EOC  Reports  Daily Activities Daily Batch listing per user iii. For any differences, generates BT  Enquiry  Electronic Journal and verifies that all transactions are successfully posted in BT to ensure there is no transaction which is “Rejected by Host” or “Unknown” or “Hold”. If any entry is found in any of the above statuses, the same should be cancelled and re -posted. iv. Generates “Cash Detai ls” report from MCB reports. Ensure that Net -off of ‘Cash Details ’ report (debit & credit) added to the opening balance of the same day should be the Closing Cash -in-hand of the day. v. Generates “Daily Cash D ay’s journal” from MCB reports. Validate all trans actio ns in order to detect any Flying entry/transaction. vi. Generate ‘GL Balances’ report to check the Cash in Vault and LCY Coins Balance for balancing purpose. Compare this report with ‘Cash Detail s’ report (generated from MCB reports). Total Physical Cash -in- Hand must tally with Cash -in-Vault and LCY Coins. vii. A summary of cash transactions of the day must be recorded in Cash Book SB 57 and signed by TSS. Branch Operations Manager signs off the Cash Book after proper validation and scrutiny of few Cash Packets, on a random basis. Moreover, Operations Manager fortnightly reviews/checks the entire Cash in Hand and the Cash Book is counter signed by Operations Manager as a token of this verification. Also mention narration “Checked and Verified”. viii. Keep Cash in Vault along with the Cash Received and Paid Stamp under dual custody of Designated Teller and Operations Manager. ix. Keep Cash Book in Fire Proof Cabinets. Besides performing the above steps for balancing; BOM should perform following steps : i. All Cash related batches should be accepted at the day end and no batch should remain opened. ii. On the following days BOM must validate the closing balance of Cash in vault of GLA -91 with Closing Balance of Cash Book and should confirm that both the balances should tally. Any difference if traced should be investigated and if required should b e reported to Region/ Circle Offices. 1.2 CASH HANDLING & CASH POSITION STATEMENT This is a prerequisite for the branches to maintain Daily Cash Position Statement as per the Annexure I V Tellers and Operations Manager have to ensure that cash must be organized in the following manner: i.

With the new arrangement in place, MCB has been given status of “Processing Bank” and hence previous arrangements (prior to April, 2010) are discontinued and no scrolls/ stub are given to NIFT/ Citiba nk or UBL. To facilitate the new process, a new system “Utility Bill Collection System” (UBCS) has been deployed at branches which can be accessed at http://10.0.0.241:7778/forms/frmservlet? config=UBCS . Branches will collect and post PTCL bills in the new system as per the process described below: 6.3.1 Receiving PTCL Utility Bill at Branch Counter i.

Payment via Cheque requires extra level of caution to ensure that the funds are realized prior to the due date positively. iii. The funds received through bill collections are retained in a separate i nternal PTCL Utility Bill Collection Account. This is a non checking account that is opened in every bill collecting branch. iv. These internal collection accounts of all designated branches are tagged with PTCL's main collection account # 0442658401000426 (ma intained at GTB Branch Karachi) for auto sweeping of funds at day end on a daily basis. v. Every morning, all PTCL bill collecting branches are required to check that the funds collected by them in their internal accounts previous day have been swept to GTB B ranch via the sweeping option or not.

At the time of bill posting by any branch in UBCS, the already uploaded data is called & marked as "Paid". iii. TBD has managed to prepare several MIS reports in UBCS. These reports are provided to PTCL on a daily basis which show the details of all bills collected on a particular day by each MCB branch. iv. Posting of billing data in UBCS is a "must" activity required to be done by the bill collecting branch. If it is not done, the billing data will no t be marked as "paid" at PTCL's end & the consumer will get the arrear hit in next bill. 6.3.3 Disposal of PTCL Bill Stubs Branches are supposed to retain the bills stubs only for 1 month. After that all stubs for the whole previous month should be sent to the local PTCL SRO Office in a single consignment. Details of concerned SRO offices have already been provided to all MCB bill collecting branches.

In case of outage, he/she gets a call from ATM Unit Karachi intimating cash outage in the branch ATM ATM Custodian calls the branch cash vault key holder(s). As a precautionary measure, ROM should be intimated about the same. Before opening cash vault, the vault ‘cash position’ is verified with the cash book and ATM Cash is checked (fact sheet). Security code for the vault door is disarm ed (if applicable). The code should only be known to the custodian(s). The key holders must ensure that all entrances leading to the vault are secured and no unauthorized persons are present. Both key holders jointly open the cash vault. Take out required cash from cash vault. Vault opening time is noted in the vault register and both custodians sign -off on the register. Cash debit voucher (non post able) is prepared and signed by both key holders and placed in the cash vault. In case both bins are not em pty, copy of the scroll with remaining cash recording should be annexed to voucher (non post able) and kept in cash vault. Cash safe(s) are securely locked and checked by both custodians to that effect. The vault closing time is noted on the vault registe r along with signatures of both custodians. The security code is activated (if applicable). Cash is replenished in the ATM as per the normal ATM cash replenishment process Cash debit voucher is posted in the system on next working day Note: i. Offsite ATM will not be replenished on a off -day ii. Branch Operations Manager should ensure Branch security Protocols are strictly adhered while visiting the Branch on a off -day/ holiday for ATM Cash replenishment 1.11 DAILY BALANCING OF A TM CASH As per the institutional and regulatory requirement it is mandatory for the ATM custodian to physically count and balance the ATM Cash on a daily basis. (Annexure XII) i. Individual transactions should be identified wherein customer account has been debited without cash disbursement. On the basis of verified transactions, branches should immediately complete process of ‘Automatic Credit’ which should not exceed the agreed t imeframe . However, for exceptional transactions such as partial retract and where primary evidence is not available, timeframe applicable from the date of claim by the customer. ii. Immediately after crediting customer account, the branches/Card Facilitation Centre must inform the customer in writing accordingly. iii. Customers whose account has been debited without cash disbursement should not be charged for minimum balance to the extent of the undisbursed amount and time for which it remained payable. Guidelines to prepare ‘Fact Sheet’ for balancing of ATM Cash: To balance the ATM cash custodians are required to prepare ‘Fact Sheet’ for each working day and ensure that the ATM cash is balanced. (Annexure XII ). Fact Sheet has four secti ons: B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 246 1.11.1 Cash Status This section contains the details of ATM Cash related data: i. Cash added in ATM ‘previous’ day: (Marked ‘A’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under category – Cash Status) This is the amount of cash that was replenished in the ATM at 15:00 Hrs the previous day. Ensure that:  The amount of cash that was replenished previous day is in agreement with the value of cash as per ‘ATM counters’ that were updated by the custodians at the time of cash replenishment. Custodian should print the cash repl enishment summary totals and keep it as a record.  The amount of cash that was replenished is in agreement with the value of ‘voucher’ used for updating the ‘Cash -in-ATM GL’ for the day. Copy of voucher should be kept with Cash Replenishment Summary. ii. Expect ed Remaining Cash: (Marked ‘O’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –I ‘Cash Status’) This is the amount of remaining cash that is calculated by the ATM based on its counters (total cash in the ATM – Cash dispensed). This information is provided on ATM Scroll in the form of number of remaining notes for each category. Custodian should print the ‘cash replenishment summary totals’ at the time of cash replenishment to get this information and calculate the amount. iii. Actual Cash Found in ATM: (Marked ‘ P’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –I ‘Cash Status’) This is the remaining cash amount found in the ATM at the time of cash replenishment and MUST be physically counted by the custodian. 1.11.2 Suspect Transactions : There are instances when the ac tual cash does not get dispensed to the customer from the ATM against suspect/un -authorized transactions due to malfunctioning of the ATM or due to communication issue, this situation may demand further investigation. This section contains the details (num ber of transactions and related amount) of Suspect Transactions for the day: i. Presenter error and Cash Retracted (Error Code 66 & 67): (Marked ‘R’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category -II ‘Suspect Transactions’) These are the transactions where ATM did present the cash but the customer failed to collect the cash within the specified time or ATM could not dispense the cash due to dispenser failure. As a result, the cash is with held or retracted by the ATM. These t ransactions are shown on the scroll as ‘authorized’ with a message “PRESENTOR ERROR” whereas, on the ATM Transaction Details & Summary Report the status of these transaction are marked as Response code 66 and under the dispensed amount column the amount is shown as ‘zero’. (These instances will result in ‘cash excess’). ii. Account debited against Response Code ‘99’ for MCB: (Marked ‘S -1’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category -II ‘Suspect Transactions’) The status of these transactions on ATM Transacti on Details & Summary Report is shown as ‘Suspect (Response code 99)’. There can be two scenarios as under: B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 247 Scenario Status On ATM Activity Report Status of Customer Account Transaction Status on GLA -29 Report Status Of Transaction on ATM Scroll Cash Dispen se Status 1 99 A/c Debited Included on GLA -29 “Transaction Authorized” Dispensed 2 99 A/c Debited Included on GLA -29 Missing on Scroll No Dispense For ATM Cash balancing purpose custodian is required to include only those transactions which meet the conditions given in scenarios # 1 i.e. Transaction is authorized on the scroll. Transactions falling under scenario # 2 will not impact ATM Cash but will create a difference in GL. To resolve this difference please refer the ‘Guidelines to Rec oncile Cash -in-ATM -GL. Note : While checking the status of suspect transactions ATM custodian MUST print customer account statement to evidence the DEBIT in customer account and should be kept as a record with Fact Sheet. iii. Funds received against Response Code ‘99’ for 1-Link: (Marked ‘S -2’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category -II ‘Suspect Transactions’) Similar to category (ii) above these are the 1 -Link suspect transactions for which funds are received from the ‘s witch’ and ATM has dispensed cash to the customer. iv. Funds received against Response Code ‘99’ for MNET : (Marked ‘S -3’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category -II ‘Suspect Transactions’) Similar to category (ii) above these are the MNET suspect tran sactions for which funds are received from the ‘switch’ and ATM has dispensed cash to the customer. v. Funds received against Response Code ‘99’ for MDS : Marked ‘S -4’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category -II ‘Suspect Transactions’) Similar to cat egory (ii) above these are the MDS suspect transactions for which funds are received from the ‘switch’ and ATM has dispensed cash to the customer. 1.11.3 Cash Balancing Summary : This is the section where above amounts given in Category I & II are considered for balancing the ATM Cash: i. Cash Fed in ATM previous day: (Marked ‘A’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) This amount is taken from last column ( marked ‘A’ ) under Category –I ‘Cash Status’ on Fact Sheet. ii. Cash Dispensed to MCB Customers – (Response Code ‘00’): (Marked ‘B’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) This is the amount of successful transactions of MCB customers for which ATM has dispensed cash during the day. However, to make this task easier for the ATM custodians a ‘NEW’ report is developed titled ‘ ATM Transaction Detail & Summary Report ’ (Annexure XIII). This new report is a replacement of old RAMS report and is ‘Transaction Sequence Range’ based. It pr ovides flexibility to the user to extract & print the complete activity of an ATM from ‘ Cash Replenishment Time ’ of day 01 to ‘Cash Replenishment Time ’ of day 02 which is the key fact or for balancing the ATM cash. B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 248 To capture the complete activity for the day for which cash is being balanced the custodian is required to:  Note down the ‘1st sequence’ number immediately after first Cash Replenishment of day 01 and the ‘last sequence’ number before the last Cash Replenishment of day 02 from AT M Scroll.  Print the new ‘ATM Transaction Detail & Summary Report’ for the range of above sequence numbers that were noted from ATM Scroll. Note down the total amount of cash dispensed given in the summary at the end of the report under the column (1) “Res = 00” for MCB customers for input in this field. Note: The old RAMS report being used for this purpose is ‘inadequate’ and should NOT be used anymore. iii. Cash Dispensed to 1 -Link Customers – (Response Code ‘00’): (Marked ‘C’ in the last column on Fact Sheet u nder Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) This is the amount of ‘successful transactions’ of 1 -Link customers for which ATM has successfully dispensed the cash during the day. (Follow the above process to get this amount from ‘ATM Transaction Detail & Su mmary Report’ ). iv. Cash Dispensed to MDS Customers – (Response Code ‘00’): (Marked ‘D’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) This is the amount of ‘successful transactions’ of MDS customers for which ATM has successful ly dispensed cash during the day. (Follow the above process to get this amount from ‘ATM Transaction Detail & Summary Report’ ). v. Cash Dispensed to MNET Customers – (Response Code ‘00’): (Marked ‘E’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash B alancing Summary’) This is the amount of ‘successful transactions’ of MNET customers for which ATM has successfully dispensed cash during the day. (Follow the above process to get this amount from ‘ATM Transaction Detail & Summary Report’ ). vi. Suspect amount debited against Error code ‘99’: (Marked ‘S’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) Input the total of ‘Response Code ‘99’ transactions noted in last column marked ‘S’ on Fact Sheet under the Category -II ‘Suspect Transactions’. vii. Cash found (counted physically) from all cassettes: (Marked ‘P’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) Input the ‘Remaining Cash’ that was found in the ATM and given in last column marked (P) on Fact Sheet under Category -I ‘Cash Status’. viii. Cash Fed in ATM if any, after flag time (15:00 M): (Marked ‘Q’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) Input the amount of ‘additional’ Cash Replenishment if any made during the day from ATM Scroll Replenishment Summary. ix. Difference: (Marked ‘W’ in the last column on Fact Sheet under Category –III ‘Cash Balancing Summary’) Make totals of two the c olumns (Debits & Credits) Debits : Cash fed in ATM previous day + Cash fed in ATM after flag time 15:00 PM, if any. Credits: Total cash dispensed + Suspect amount debited against error code 99 + Remaining Cash found in ATM). B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 249 Compar e the Debit and Credit totals:  If the ‘Total Debits’ a gree with ‘Total Credits’ then there is no difference and ATM Cash is balanced.  If the ‘Total Debits’ do not agree with ‘Total Credits’ then ATM Cash has a difference. Custodian is required to investigate this difference. 1.11.4 Itemized Details of Difference: Difference if any, MUST be investigated to identify the transaction(s) creating that difference and it is mandatory for the custodian to individually list the details of these transaction(s) in this section. Resolution of Difference: For resolution of dif ference it is mandatory for the ATM custodian to: i. Check that the transaction(s) creating the difference are listed in ‘Proactive Module’. ii. Post Cash with ATM GL balancing carried out of the same date. iii. Check from statement of account (MCB customers) that cu stomer account was debited. iv. Check the status of ‘receipt of funds’ for MNET, 1 -LINK & MDS related transactions from Switch Settlement Unit. 1.12 STEPS TO FOLLOW FOR CASH BALANCING IN CA SE RAMS REPORT IS NO T AVAILABLE 1.12.1 ATM Cash Balancing (From Scroll) i. Take physical scroll of ATM & manually calculate cash dispense totals for MCB & Non MCB transactions. ii. MCB C ards bin # (5893887 & 5893882). Rest of the card numbers will be for other banks using on MCB ATM. iii. Cash withdrawal entries totals of ATM transaction s for cash balancing to be considered from 1st sequence number after last cash replenishment ( 15:00 hrs ) to last sequence number of current date before cash replenishment at (15:00 hrs.) iv. Combined totals for MCB & Other banks cards & consider it as cash dispensed. v. ATM Scroll also need be checked for problem transactions e.g. response codes 99 / 66 / 28 etc to validate cash dispense status to ensure proper cash balancing. vi. Now compare cash replenished previously against the cash dispensed plus remaining cas h as per existing process requirement to find any difference and then identify relevant transaction creating the differences as detailed in the process guidelines for preparing the Fact Sheet. vii. An ATM with no problem transactions would ideally be balanced for cash. viii. Follow steps mentioned above to carry out Cash balancing (without RAMS report support) exercise daily till RAMS is available. Upon RAMS report availability all the workings for Cash balancing must be reconciled by generating required RAMS reports of the said dates to ensure error free process continuation in this regard.

DRU: Dispute Resolution Unit 1.14 RECONCILIATION OF AT M CASH WITH CASH -IN-ATM GL As per the institutional and regulatory requirement it is mandatory for the ATM custodian to Reconcile ATM Cash with “Cash -in-ATM GL” of the branch on a daily basis (Annexure XIV). Difference if any, must be investigated to fin d out the transaction(s) creating the difference and corrective entries should be passed the same day. 1.14.1 Guidelines to Reconcile ATM Cash with Cash -in-ATM GL: The branch GL for Cash -in-ATM reports the status of ATM Cash as of end -of-day (00:00 Hrs) when SYMBOLS end of day is executed. To reconcile the physical cash in the ATM with the corresponding balance on the GL it is required to get to know the ATM Cash pos ition at the end of day at 00:00 Hrs. B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 252 SECTION “A” : ATM Cash Position at the end of previous day (24:00 Hrs) To find out the cash position at the end -of-previous day ATM custodians are required to perform the following steps: i. Remaining Cash in the ATM: Count the physical ‘remaining cash’ found in the ATM at the time of cash replenishment at 15:00 Hrs (it should be the same amount that is used for balancing ATM cash for the day). ii. Additional Cash Replenished, If any Any additional cash replenishments durin g the day except to standard time of 15:00 to be subtracted iii. Cash dispensed after end -of-previous day till Cash Replenishment time: Calculate the cash that was dispensed after ‘end -of-day’ (00:00 Hrs) until Cash Replenishment time (15:00 Hrs). This is the a mount of cash that was available in the ATM at end -of-day (00:00 Hrs) and was dispensed after end -of-day until cash replenishment time (15:00 Hrs) and as such, should be considered as ‘physical cash’ on hand for GL reconciliation purpose. To get this amou nt follow the step given below: Note down the 1st transaction sequence after Symbols EOD (00:00 Hrs) for previous day and the last transaction sequence number before the cash replenishment for the day from ATM Scroll. Then print the “ATM Transaction Detail s & Summary Report” for the noted sequence range. (For this purpose, week -ends & holidays should be treated as one Business day). This amount can also be calculated manually from ATM Scroll by adding up the total successful cash withdrawals for the given t ransaction sequence numbers . iv. Cash dispensed on previous Business day for MNET, 1Link, MDS transactions: This is the amount of cash that was dispensed for ‘Others’ (MNET, 1Link & MDS) customers on previous day but not posted/updated on the GL for the day du e to system limitations and as such, should be considered as cash on hand for GL reconciliation purpose. To get this amount follow the step given below: Note down the 1st transaction sequence number after midnight of day before previous day and the last t ransaction sequence number before the midnight of previous day . Print the 'activity report' from new RAMS report for the noted transaction sequence range. v. Total Cash in ATM at the end -of-day (00:00 Hrs): Calculate the amount of physical cash that was available in the ATM at the end of previous day (00:00 Hrs) by adding up the amount of point Nos. 1, 2 and 3 above. SECTION “B” : GL Balance of Cash -in-ATM for the day: Note down the GL balance for Cash -in-ATM of the branch for the day from GLA -91 report o f the branch. SECTION “C” : Difference between ATM Cash vs. Cash -in-ATM GL: Compare the ‘total cash in ATM’ given under point # 4 above which should agree with Cash -in-ATM GL balance given under point # 5. The difference, if any must be investigated and corrective entries must be passed the same day. However for differences relate d to response code 99 and 66 must be validated through ‘Proactive module’ and marked for required action taken. Possible scenarios of difference: i. Ensure that MNET/1LINK/MDS/MIBS offline entries of the day before previous day are B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 253 posted/updated on the GL. For all response code 99 transactions of MNET & 1Link funds are exchanged by the switch & credit for the same amount is due in Cash with ATM GL of the branch. ii. Cash dispensed but NO accounting entry is passed by the system (i.e. Debit customer & Credit cash). In this scenario GL will be more than the physical cash. For such instances custodian should: Dr= Customer Account Cr= Cash in ATM GL iii. Cash retract instances where ‘cash excess’ was highlighted during balancing of ‘ATM Cash’. In these instances physi cal cash will be more than the GL. For such instances custodian should: Dr= Cash in ATM GL Cr= Customer Account iv. Suspect transactions (code=99) where customer account is debited, cash is NOT dispensed but the transaction is included in “Cash in ATM Accounting Entries Report” for GL update. In these instances though the physical cash on Fact Sheet will be balanced but will create difference while reconciling the GL (Physical cash will be more). For such instances custodian should: Dr= Cash in ATM GL Cr= Customer Account Note : Do not reverse the transaction using manual entry through vouchers EXCEPT for ‘Partial Dispense’ instances SECTION “D” : Itemized Details of Difference: Difference if any, MUST be investigated to identify the transaction(s) creating that difference and it is mandatory for the custodian to individually list the details of these transaction(s) in this section. 1.15 STEPS TO FOLLOW FOR GL BALANCING IN CASE RAMS REPORT IS NOT AVAILA BLE 1.15.1 ATM GL Balancing (From Scroll) i. Take remaining physical cash position till 15:00 hrs. ii. Any additional cash replenishments during the day except to standard time of 15:00 to be subtracted. iii. Take physical scroll of ATM & manually calcul ate cash dispense totals for MCB & Non MCB transactions from 1st sequence number after 00:00 hrs till 15:00 hrs last sequence # before cash replenishment of the current day. iv. MCB Ca rds bin # (5893887 & 5893882). Rest of the card numbers will be for other banks using MCB ATM. v. Take other banks transactions (MNET / 1Link / MDS) from physical scroll of night before previous sequence # between 00:00 to 00:00 hrs last night for e.g. if today is August 04, 2010 then sequence # to be considered for this step woul d be of following timing August 03, 2010, 1st sequence of this date after 00:00 hrs till last sequence # 00:00 hrs of the same date. (August 03, 2010 24hrs). vi. Add all above three figures to work out cash in ATM at 00:00 hrs last night. vii. Take Cash with ATM GL balance from the GLA 91. viii. Compare both figures to work out the difference if any. B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 254 ix. In case of differences, it need be resolved and said differences noted in section – D, however due to any unforeseen situation if difference could not be resolved the same day and its impact need be accounted for and carried forward to next day balancing exercise to have proper GL balancing be done onward & keep the required process continuity. x. Follow steps mentioned above to carry out GL balancing (without RAMS report supp ort) exercise daily till RAMS is available. Upon RAMS report availability all the workings for GL balancing must be reconciled by generating required RAMS reports of the said dates to ensure error free process continuation in this regard. 1.16 MCB ATM / SMART CARD PROACTIVE TRANS ACTION SETTLEMENT MCB ATM/Smart Card Proactive Transaction settlement Module is an intranet -based module that runs in all MCB branches & Dispute Resolution Unit (DRU). Branches can view all the suspect transactions of last working day pertaining to their ATM/s. The list of suspect transaction is uploaded in the system on daily basis. These suspect transactions are of Response Code ‘99’ and ‘66’ only. 1.16.1 Suspect Transaction Categories: The suspect Transactions are divided in three main categories: i. Self Branch Suspect – (Where Card and ATM machine pertains to same MCB Branch) ii. Cross Branch Suspect – (Where Card and ATM machine pertains to different MCB Branches) iii. M-Net & 1 Link Suspect – (Where M -Net & 1 Link MCB ATM/Smart Cards are used o n MCB ATM machine) 1.16.2 Main Features: i. User can view suspect transactions, which are grouped according to their respective Branch ATM ID’s. ii. Search option is available. User can look for the suspect transactions on the basis of Date or Sequence number. iii. It prov ides reports to the branches for record keeping. iv. TAT can be monitored through these reports 1.16.3 Process to view and mark suspect transactions: The input user needs to follow the following steps in order to mark Cash Position, ‘Scroll Status’ and ‘Account Debited or Not’ against Suspect Transactions in the ATM Proactive Transaction Settlement System. i. Authorized User (By Manager) has to Login by using User ID & Password. ii. Click View Suspects Tab on the top menu bar on Main Screen. The self -branch suspect tran saction list will be displayed on the screen. For viewing Cross Branch or M -Net & 1 Link suspects, click the respective link at the top of the page. iii. Click the STAN No link to view the complete details of each suspect transaction. iv. Screen will show the deta ils such as: Sequence No, ATM ID, Response Code, Customer Name, card, account number etc. User will check the Account Debited (For MCB customer transactions) or Funds Received field (For MNET/ 1 Link transactions). Select appropriate Radio Button “Yes” or “No”. v. Select the appropriate Status on scroll (list of which is given below: Table Scroll Status) from the Dropdown list by comparing the transaction details against the ATM scroll. NOTE: It is mandatory to mark the Cash Position (list of which is given be low: Table Scroll Status) against Suspect Transaction in the said module on daily basis in order to enable the system to auto reconcile the transactions. Failure to do so will increase the number of suspect transactions in the system .

According to our focus group findings, people have deposit account relationship with mostly local banks. Moreover, a bank account pen etration is at a household level but not at individual level. Individuals especially the housewives prefer a separate card for themselves rather than a supplementary card from husband and are moving towards an individualistic outlook generally where they c an plan and control. Also, due to declining credit availability, it has become difficult to surpass the criterion made to be eligible for credit cards. This further initiates the requirement for a different solution. In addition to the above, the basic generator of revenue through prepaid is on its point -of-sale usage and in Pakistan the growth in acquiring network has increased from 20,000 in 2006 to 55,000 in 2009, identifying Prepaid as an opportunity to earn in the credit crunch persistent right now. MCB Visa Prepaid Card is pre -funded reload -able card that is easy to use and is safer than cash. The prepaid card provides a means to penetrate at an individual level by reaching new consumer and commercial segments that currently rely on cash and cheques for payment. Operating in a similar fashion to debit card accounts, but with greater flexibility and lesser risk for both the issuer and the cardholder, prepaid cards may be issued in many cases where the applicant would not qualify for a credit or debit card. Visa prepaid cards can be used to access previously deposited funds in a Prepaid account. The funds in the account may be spent by the cardholder through purchase transactions or cash withdrawals or reduced by the issuer applying fees. Initially, th is card will be launched with 5 design variants against three Prepaid packages which are subsequently differentiated with respect to the limit on maximum deposit, ATM withdrawal, POS usage and internet transaction. 3.1 BRANCH RESPONSIBILIT IES The Commercial Branch Banking Group will entertain the internal and external customers through its branches for card issuance and payment collection for load/reload.

CORONA is live with effect from June 1st , 2010 and the legacy system is discontinued from the same date. This would help in bringing better control on data completeness, place emphasis on transactions not being timely responded through identification of number of days outstanding and also providing branches/units more time to respond / to resolve transactions , which are outstanding at their end. This chapter narrates the new process of delivery to the branches / units and elaborates layout of the new Inter branch transaction summary along with the underlying transactions. Inter branch reconciliation will be performed on a weekly basis in CORONA and reports will be sent to the respective Branch Managers (BM) /Branch Operations Managers (BOM) and respective units’ representatives through Bank’s current email set up. In addition the format of the report has been completely r evamped with respect to its layout and provision of information. Following are the key changes: i.

The aging buckets are as follows :  up to 7 days  from 8 to 15 days  from 16 to 30 days  Total up to 30 days  More than 30 days ii. The new format categorizes the transactions under different currencies being used currently in transaction processing. iii. The new format provides currency wise Head Office General Ledger Account movement (HO GL). iv. The new format provides information on transactions to be responded by other branches. v. The new layout will be referred as “Inter -branch Transaction Reconciliation Summary” . Summary will be supported by underlying transactions report. The report would be branch wise and defining the period for which data has been processed for matching. Inter branch transaction reconciliation summary is mainly divided in Five (5) s ections: 6.1 OUTSTANDING TRANSACT IONS AT BRANCH END A GING ANALYSIS These are transactions, which the branch needs to resolve/respond. The sum of section (1) is represented as “Total Outstanding / Unresolved transactions at Branch end” i.

These certificates are encashable at par any time after the date of purchase. However, no profit is payable if encashment is made before completion of one year. The DSCs are registered certificates; the name of the person is mentioned on the certificates and only that person can encash the certificates. But the holder can nominate an individual as nominee of th e certificates and these nominees can operate the certificates on holder’s death (subject to the prevailing laws applicable in Pakistan at the time of encashment). Therefore it is prudent to obtain Legal Opinion in such circumstances before processing the transaction. Guidelines are subject to change in Defence Saving Certificates rules 1996 and any other relevant rules and regulations issued by the Government of Pakistan from time to time. DSCs can only be encashed from the bank where these certificates we re issued. The DSCs are issued to account holders only, walk –in customers are to be avoided.

Bank’s approved KYC & AML policy should be strictly complied for walk -in customers; in addition, verification of computerized CNIC should be done through NADRA VERYSIS. DSC has no profit coupons and is a single certificate. On the reverse, the profit schedule is printed which denotes the value of the certificate after completion of each year. In case of premature encashment profit is entitled only for completed year for e xample, if a customer wants to encash the certificate between B r a n c h O p e r a t i o n s M a n u a l – V e r s i o n 2 . 0 - D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 0 P a g e | 325 eighteen months after the date of issuance, he will receive the profit of the first year only and no profit would be given to him for the remaining eight months. Stamp of latest approved rates should be affixed on reverse of the DSC. At the time of encashment, 2.50% (of Zakat) to be collected at source as per rules . However, non –Muslim and followers of different sects as described by the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance 1980 are exempted from Zakat, bu t followers of certain sects e.g. Shias, Quadians etc. have to submit an indemnity on a Bond paper attested by the Oath Commissioner for such exemptions. The minimum amount of DSCs that a customer is to be issued is PKR. 500 and there is no maximum limit f or its issuance. 8.2 ISSUANCE OF DSC 8.2.1 Procedure for Issuance of DSC by Main Branch : Printed forms are available from the government securities desk if a person wants to buy DSCs.

The sub -branches will be a conduit of a branch to which it is affiliated. Banks will be required to apply to SBP for opening of sub -branches approved under ABEP on the prescribed format (Annexure - II & II - A). Banks will not be allowed to convert any of their existing branches into sub branches. However, they can convert a booth into a sub -branch & a sub -branch into a full -fledged branch only after approval under their ABEP and in terms of BLP. Banks will be allowed to open sub -branches subject to criteria mentioned at section -2.2 above, centralization of processing of all the transactions at sub -branches to a base branch, existence of a ppropriate systems & controls and adequate security arrangements. Further, all relevant record shall be maintained by the controlling branch. It would be preferable if banks resort to technology based solutions in sub -branches including on -line/real time links, kiosks, ATMs, Point of Sales etc as also use drop box facilities. The bank will ensure compliance with all the laws, rules regulations and SBP instructions issued from time to time, which may affect the existence/ operations of the sub -branch. The s ub branches can perform one or both of the following functions: - Limited general banking functions viz cash receipt and payment, issuance and encashment of DD, TT, MT, pay order, traveler cheques etc. However, account opening & issuance of account number and other formalities including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) shall be performed by the controlling branch (not by sub -branch). The general banking functions may also include the functions performed a t permanent booths as stated in section ‘2.6.1’ . Disbursement & recovery of agri/rural financing, group based lending, lodgment & settlement of insurance claims of agri/rural loans and to create awareness amongst the rural consumer about agri/rural financ e products & services. A signboard stating the name of the bank at sub -branch should also state under the bank’s name in clear bold words that “This is a sub -branch/limited function branch of……..Bank” in English as well as in Urdu. Section ‘2.6.1’ (i) Receiv ing utility bills, Government dues/revenue/cash, collection of fees/dues of educational institutions, collection and disbursements of loans to farmers, receiving cash from patients of hospitals, visa application/visa fee or other related cash receipt funct ions on the recommendations of the concerned Government Departments, other institutions and for providing limited banking facilities (i.e. cash payment and receipt of cash and cheques/demand draft/pay order only) in the premises of Embassies, Consulates, F oreign Missions and International Financial Institutions in Pakistan, on their specific request.
