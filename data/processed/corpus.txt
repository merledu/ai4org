A. Core Customer Operations Policies
Category 1: Account Management Policies
1.1 Account Opening and Maintenance Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for opening, operating, and
maintaining customer accounts at Amanah Bank. It ensures that all account-
related activities adhere to regulatory requirements while delivering seamless
banking experiences. The policy aims to protect customer interests while
maintaining operational efficiency and compliance with applicable laws.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all types of deposit accounts including savings accounts,
current accounts, fixed deposit accounts, and special purpose accounts offered
by Amanah Bank. It covers individual accounts, joint accounts, minor accounts,
corporate accounts, and accounts for non-profit organizations. The policy
governs account opening procedures, maintenance requirements, dormancy
management, and reactivation processes across all branches and digital channels.
3. Definitions
Customer: Any individual or entity holding or applying for an account with
Amanah Bank. Account: A financial relationship established between the Customer
and the Bank for deposit, withdrawal, and transaction purposes. Dormant Account:
An account with no customer-initiated transactions for a continuous period of
twelve months. Primary Account Holder: The main person responsible for account
operations and compliance. Authorized Signatory: Person(s) designated by the
account holder to conduct transactions on their behalf.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank commits to providing transparent, accessible, and secure account
services to all eligible customers. Account opening requires valid
identification, proof of address, and completion of KYC documentation as per
regulatory mandates. The Bank maintains the right to accept or decline account
applications based on risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and internal
policies. All accounts must maintain minimum balance requirements as specified
in the fee schedule. Accounts inactive for twelve months will be classified as
dormant and subject to reactivation procedures. The Bank reserves the right to
freeze or close accounts involved in suspicious activities, policy violations,
or upon regulatory direction.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate, complete, and current information during
account opening and promptly update any changes to personal details, contact
information, or authorized signatories. Customers are responsible for
maintaining minimum balance requirements and understanding applicable fees and
charges. Account holders must safeguard their account credentials, cheque books,
debit cards, and immediately report any unauthorized transactions or suspected
fraud. Customers must ensure sufficient funds before issuing cheques or
authorizing payments. Joint account holders must clearly communicate authority
levels and transaction permissions. Customers are required to review account
statements regularly and report discrepancies within thirty days.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall process account opening applications within three business
days of receiving complete documentation. The Bank will provide clear
communication about account features, fees, interest rates, and terms and
conditions at the time of account opening. Monthly statements will be provided
through the customer's preferred channel (physical or electronic) within five
business days of month-end. The Bank shall maintain strict confidentiality of
customer information and implement robust security measures to protect account
data. Amanah Bank will promptly investigate and resolve customer complaints
related to account operations. The Bank shall notify customers at least thirty
days in advance of any changes to fees, interest rates, or account terms.
Dormant accounts will be reactivated within two business days upon customer
request and identity verification.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Minimum balance requirements may be waived for students, senior citizens,
persons with disabilities, and financially disadvantaged segments as per the
Bank's financial inclusion initiatives. Account opening for non-residents,
foreign nationals, and politically exposed persons (PEPs) requires enhanced due
diligence and additional documentation. The Bank may levy charges for excessive
transactions, premature account closures, or non-maintenance of minimum balance
as per the published fee schedule. Joint accounts operate on "either or
survivor" or "former or survivor" basis as specified by account holders. In
cases of legal disputes, court orders, or regulatory investigations, the Bank
may restrict account operations without prior notice. Interest rates on savings
and deposit accounts are subject to change based on market conditions and
monetary policy.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with the State Bank of Pakistan regulations, Anti-Money
Laundering Act, Consumer Protection guidelines, and applicable banking laws. The
policy will be reviewed annually or whenever significant regulatory changes
occur. Account opening procedures are audited quarterly to ensure adherence to
KYC/AML norms. Customer complaints regarding account management are tracked,
analyzed, and incorporated into policy improvements. All staff involved in
account operations receive mandatory training on this policy twice annually. The
Bank maintains comprehensive audit trails of all account opening, modification,
and closure activities for regulatory inspection.
1.2 Joint Account Operations Policy
1. Purpose
This policy defines the operational framework for joint accounts, establishing
clear guidelines for account ownership, transaction authority, and dispute
resolution. It aims to protect the interests of all joint account holders while
ensuring smooth account operations. The policy provides transparency regarding
rights, responsibilities, and operational modes of joint accounts.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all joint accounts held by two or more individuals at
Amanah Bank, including savings accounts, current accounts, and fixed deposits.
It covers joint accounts operated under different modes such as "either or
survivor," "former or survivor," "jointly," or "anyone or survivor." The policy
governs transaction authorization, signature requirements, dispute resolution,
and succession procedures. It excludes corporate accounts with multiple
authorized signatories, which are governed by corporate banking policies.
3. Definitions
Joint Account: An account held by two or more individuals with shared ownership.
Either or Survivor: Operating mode allowing any account holder to transact
independently, with surviving holder(s) inheriting the account upon death.
Former or Survivor: Mode where the first-named holder has primary authority,
with survivor inheritance rights. Jointly: Mode requiring all account holders'
signatures for any transaction. Primary Holder: First-named account holder with
primary communication and documentation responsibilities. Secondary Holder(s):
Additional account holder(s) with rights as per the operating mode.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank offers joint accounts to facilitate shared financial management
between family members, business partners, or other relationships. At account
opening, holders must specify the operating mode, which cannot be changed
without written consent from all holders. For "either or survivor" accounts, any
holder can conduct transactions independently without other holders' consent.
"Jointly" operated accounts require signatures from all holders for withdrawals,
transfers, or account modifications. The Bank is not liable for disputes between
joint holders and will honor instructions as per the specified operating mode.
Upon death of a joint holder, survivor(s) automatically inherit the account
balance unless contrary legal instructions exist. All joint holders are jointly
and severally liable for overdrafts, loan obligations, and account-related
liabilities.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Joint account holders must clearly specify and document the operating mode at
account opening and ensure all holders understand their rights and obligations.
Each holder is responsible for maintaining confidentiality of their credentials
and transaction activities. Holders must promptly communicate disputes, changes
in relationship, or requests for mode changes in writing to the Bank. In "either
or survivor" accounts, holders must maintain mutual trust as any holder can
independently withdraw the entire balance. Holders are responsible for
monitoring account activity and reporting unauthorized transactions within the
stipulated timeframe. In case of death, surviving holders must notify the Bank
immediately and provide necessary documentation for account transmission. All
holders must comply with tax reporting obligations as applicable to their share
of account income.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall clearly explain operating modes, implications, and risks
before joint account opening. The Bank will maintain accurate records of all
joint holders' details, signatures, and the specified operating mode.
Transaction processing will strictly follow the operating mode instructions, and
the Bank will not accept transactions that violate the specified mode. In cases
of conflicting instructions from joint holders, the Bank shall freeze the
account until all holders provide unanimous written instructions or legal
resolution is obtained. Upon notification of a holder's death, the Bank will
provide smooth transmission of account to survivor(s) subject to verification of
legal documents. The Bank shall issue separate tax certificates to each joint
holder for their proportionate share of interest income. All correspondence will
be sent to the primary holder's address unless specific instructions exist for
other holders.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Joint accounts cannot be opened for minors as primary holders; however, minors
can be secondary holders with guardian consent. The "either or survivor" mode
carries inherent risk of one holder withdrawing all funds without consent of
others. The Bank is not responsible for resolving personal disputes between
joint holders and will honor account operations as per the registered mode. In
cases where legal heirs of a deceased joint holder dispute account transmission,
the Bank may require legal indemnification or court orders before allowing
operations. Operating mode changes require physical presence of all joint
holders at the branch with valid identification. For NRI (Non-Resident Indian)
joint accounts, at least one holder must be resident as per foreign exchange
regulations.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan guidelines on joint accounts,
succession laws, and consumer protection regulations. Joint account operations
are reviewed during internal audits to ensure compliance with specified
operating modes. The policy is reviewed biennially or upon significant
regulatory changes. Customer disputes regarding joint accounts are analyzed to
identify policy improvement areas. Staff training on joint account procedures is
conducted annually with emphasis on dispute scenarios. The Bank maintains
detailed records of operating mode specifications, holder communications, and
dispute resolutions for regulatory compliance.
1.3 Minor Account Management Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for opening and managing accounts for minors
(individuals below 18 years), promoting early financial literacy while ensuring
proper guardianship and protection. It aims to balance the educational benefits
of banking for minors with necessary safeguards and regulatory compliance. The
policy protects minors' interests while enabling age-appropriate financial
independence.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all savings and fixed deposit accounts opened for minors
below 18 years of age at Amanah Bank. It covers accounts opened by parents,
legal guardians, or court-appointed guardians on behalf of minors. The policy
governs transaction limits, guardian responsibilities, account conversion
procedures upon attaining majority, and operational restrictions. It applies to
individual minor accounts and excludes joint accounts where minors are secondary
holders, which are governed by joint account policies.
3. Definitions
Minor: Individual below 18 years of age as per applicable law. Guardian: Parent,
legal guardian, or court-appointed guardian authorized to operate the minor's
account. Natural Guardian: Biological or adoptive parent managing the minor's
financial affairs. Legal Guardian: Court-appointed individual authorized to
manage minor's property and finances. Conversion: Process of converting a minor
account to a regular adult account upon the minor attaining 18 years. Gift
Deposits: Contributions made to minor accounts by relatives or well-wishers on
special occasions.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank encourages parents and guardians to open accounts for minors to
instill savings habits and financial literacy from an early age. Minor accounts
can only be opened by natural guardians (parents) or legal guardians with
appropriate documentation. All transactions on minor accounts must be conducted
by the registered guardian until the minor attains 10 years of age. Minors aged
10-18 years may be allowed limited transaction capabilities such as deposits and
ATM withdrawals up to specified limits with guardian consent. The guardian is
fully responsible for account operations, compliance, and any liabilities until
the minor attains majority. Upon reaching 18 years, minor accounts are
automatically converted to regular savings accounts subject to completion of
fresh KYC documentation. No loans, overdrafts, or credit facilities can be
extended against minor accounts. The Bank prioritizes the minor's welfare in all
account-related decisions and disputes.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Guardians must provide complete and accurate documentation including the minor's
birth certificate, guardian's identification, proof of guardianship, and address
proof at account opening. Guardians are responsible for all transactions,
maintaining minimum balance, and ensuring the account is operated in the minor's
best interest. Any funds deposited must be legitimate and guardians must provide
source of funds information for large deposits. Guardians must update the Bank
regarding any changes in guardianship, contact information, or the minor's
status. Upon the minor attaining 18 years, guardians must ensure timely
conversion by facilitating completion of fresh KYC documents. Guardians must not
use minor account funds for personal purposes and must maintain transparent
records of deposits and withdrawals. The minor, upon attaining 10 years, must
safeguard ATM cards, PIN, and report any unauthorized transactions immediately.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall verify guardianship credentials thoroughly before account
opening, ensuring the guardian has legal authority to act on the minor's behalf.
The Bank will provide age-appropriate financial literacy materials and conduct
periodic awareness programs for minors and guardians. Special passbooks or
account statements designed for minors will be provided to make banking engaging
and educational. The Bank shall monitor minor accounts for unusual activities
and report suspicious transactions as per AML regulations. Interest rates
offered on minor accounts will be competitive and clearly communicated at
account opening. The Bank will proactively contact guardians three months before
the minor attains 18 years to initiate the conversion process. Upon conversion,
the Bank shall transfer all account-related authorities to the account holder
and remove guardian access. The Bank shall maintain strict confidentiality and
prevent unauthorized access to minor account information.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Transaction limits for minors aged 10-18 are set at PKR 5,000 per day for ATM
withdrawals and PKR 10,000 per month for total withdrawals. These limits may be
revised periodically. No cheque book, internet banking, or mobile banking
facilities are provided for minor accounts. Minors cannot be added as nominees
or authorized signatories on other accounts. In cases of guardian disputes,
death, or incapacity, the Bank requires legal documentation (court orders or
succession certificates) before allowing account access. Gift deposits exceeding
PKR 100,000 in a financial year require declaration of source and relationship
to the minor. The Bank reserves the right to freeze minor accounts if fraudulent
or improper use is suspected until legal clarification is obtained.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan regulations, Guardians and
Wards Act, Child Protection laws, and KYC/AML norms specific to minor accounts.
The policy is reviewed annually with focus on enhancing financial literacy
initiatives for minors. Guardian verification procedures are audited quarterly
to ensure proper documentation and authority confirmation. Staff handling minor
accounts receive specialized training on child protection, guardian rights, and
age-appropriate customer service. Customer feedback from guardians is collected
and analyzed to improve minor account features and educational programs. The
Bank maintains detailed records of guardianship documents, conversion processes,
and any disputes for regulatory inspection.
1.4 Account Dormancy and Reactivation Policy
1. Purpose
This policy defines procedures for classifying, managing, and reactivating
dormant accounts to protect customer funds while maintaining regulatory
compliance. It aims to encourage regular account usage, prevent fraud, and
ensure dormant funds are eventually reunited with rightful owners. The policy
balances customer convenience with security requirements for inactive accounts.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all savings accounts, current accounts, and other deposit
accounts that become inactive due to lack of customer-initiated transactions. An
account is classified as dormant after twelve consecutive months without
customer-initiated debits or credits, excluding bank-initiated transactions like
interest credits, fee debits, or dividend credits. The policy covers dormancy
identification, notification procedures, operational restrictions, reactivation
processes, and escheatment (transfer to government) for long-term dormant
accounts. It excludes fixed deposits and term deposits which are governed by
separate maturity-based policies.
3. Definitions
Dormant Account: Account with no customer-initiated transaction for twelve
consecutive months. Customer-Initiated Transaction: Deposits, withdrawals,
transfers, or other instructions initiated by the account holder. Inactive
Account: Account approaching dormancy (9-11 months without transactions).
Reactivation: Process of restoring full operational status to a dormant account.
Escheatment: Transfer of unclaimed dormant account funds to government
authorities after the statutory period. Bank-Initiated Transaction: Interest
credits, service charges, or regulatory debits not constituting customer
activity.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank proactively monitors account activity and classifies accounts as
dormant after twelve months of customer inactivity to prevent unauthorized
transactions and protect customer interests. Customers will receive advance
notification when accounts approach dormancy status at nine months of
inactivity. Dormant accounts are restricted from certain operations including
cheque issuance, ATM withdrawals, internet banking, and mobile banking to
prevent fraud. Existing cheques, standing instructions, and auto-debit
facilities are suspended upon dormancy classification. Reactivation requires
customer verification through in-person visit with valid identification or
through secure digital verification processes. The Bank maintains dormant
account funds securely and continues to credit interest as applicable. Accounts
dormant for ten years with balances below PKR 1,000 may be escheated to
government authorities as per regulatory requirements. The Bank makes reasonable
efforts to contact customers before escheatment.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must maintain regular account activity through deposits, withdrawals,
or other transactions to prevent dormancy classification. Upon receiving
dormancy alert notifications, customers should either conduct transactions or
visit the branch to confirm account status. Customers are responsible for
maintaining updated contact information to receive dormancy alerts and
reactivation instructions. For reactivation, customers must visit the branch
with valid original identification documents and provide reasons for inactivity
if requested. Customers should review account statements to identify and report
any unauthorized transactions that may have occurred before dormancy
classification. Upon reactivation, customers must update KYC documents if they
have expired during the dormancy period. Customers should consolidate multiple
dormant accounts to simplify account management and reduce maintenance costs.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall monitor all accounts monthly to identify those approaching
dormancy and send notification letters or emails to customers at nine months of
inactivity. Upon classifying an account as dormant, the Bank will restrict high-
risk transaction channels while maintaining the account's security and
continuing to credit applicable interest. The Bank shall maintain separate
records and monitoring systems for dormant accounts with enhanced security
measures. Reactivation requests will be processed within two business days upon
satisfactory verification of customer identity and account ownership. The Bank
will provide multiple reactivation channels including branch visits, video KYC,
and authorized representative processes. Prior to escheatment, the Bank shall
make three attempts to contact the customer through registered mail, email, and
phone over a six-month period. Escheated funds can be reclaimed by customers
even after transfer to government by providing appropriate documentation. The
Bank shall maintain comprehensive records of all dormancy classifications,
reactivations, and escheatment actions for audit purposes.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Accounts with loan obligations, active standing instructions, or auto-debit
mandates may not be fully restricted during dormancy but will have enhanced
monitoring. Senior citizen accounts and disability pension accounts receive
extended dormancy periods (18 months) before classification. Accounts held by
NRIs, seafarers, or individuals on long-term overseas assignments may request
dormancy exemption with appropriate documentation. No additional charges are
levied for dormancy classification or reactivation; however, regular account
maintenance fees continue unless waived by specific schemes. Dormant accounts
with active fixed deposits or recurring deposits linked to them will not be
escheated until all linked deposits mature. In cases where the account holder is
deceased and legal heirs have not claimed the funds, escheatment timelines are
extended pending legal resolution.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy adheres to State Bank of Pakistan guidelines on dormant accounts,
Consumer Protection regulations, and Escheatment Acts. Dormant account
identification and classification processes are automated and audited quarterly
for accuracy. The policy is reviewed annually with focus on improving customer
communication and reactivation procedures. Customer complaints regarding
incorrect dormancy classification or reactivation difficulties are tracked and
analyzed for process improvements. Staff receive annual training on dormancy
management, reactivation procedures, and customer sensitivity regarding inactive
accounts. The Bank submits periodic reports to regulatory authorities on dormant
account statistics, escheatment actions, and reactivation rates. Technological
enhancements are continuously evaluated to improve dormancy detection and
customer alert mechanisms.
Category 2: Customer Onboarding and Verification (KYC/AML) Policies
2.1 Know Your Customer (KYC) Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive procedures for customer identification,
verification, and due diligence to prevent identity fraud, money laundering,
terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. It ensures Amanah Bank
maintains accurate customer information while complying with regulatory
mandates. The policy aims to balance robust security measures with customer
convenience and privacy protection.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customers opening new accounts, existing customers
updating information, and beneficial owners of legal entity customers at Amanah
Bank. It covers individual customers, corporate entities, partnerships, trusts,
non-profit organizations, and other legal structures. The policy governs initial
KYC at onboarding, periodic KYC updates, enhanced due diligence for high-risk
customers, and simplified due diligence for low-risk segments. It applies across
all channels including branches, digital onboarding platforms, and third-party
agent networks.
3. Definitions
KYC (Know Your Customer): Process of verifying customer identity and assessing
risk profiles. Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Standard verification procedures
for regular customers. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Rigorous verification for
high-risk customers including PEPs and high-value clients. Simplified Due
Diligence (SDD): Streamlined verification for low-risk customers such as
government employees. Politically Exposed Person (PEP): Individual holding
prominent public functions with potential corruption risks. Beneficial Owner:
Ultimate individual(s) owning or controlling a legal entity customer. Officially
Valid Document (OVD): Government-issued identity document acceptable for KYC
verification.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank will not open accounts or establish banking relationships without
satisfactory completion of KYC procedures as per regulatory requirements. All
customers must provide Officially Valid Documents for identity and address
verification at account opening. Acceptable OVDs include National Identity Card
(CNIC/NICOP), Passport, Driving License, and other government-issued photo
identification. For address verification, utility bills, rent agreements, or
employer certificates not older than three months are required. Customer
information must be verified through independent reliable sources, and face-to-
face verification is mandatory for high-risk customers. Enhanced due diligence
is mandatory for PEPs, non-resident customers, high net worth individuals, and
customers from high-risk jurisdictions. KYC information must be updated at least
once every two years for individual customers and annually for corporate
customers. The Bank conducts ongoing due diligence through transaction
monitoring and periodic information updates. Customer information is
confidential and used solely for compliance, risk management, and regulatory
reporting purposes.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide genuine, complete, and accurate information during
account opening and KYC verification processes. Original documents must be
presented for verification; photocopies are retained by the Bank after
verification against originals. Customers are required to inform the Bank within
fifteen days of any changes to name, address, contact information, occupation,
or income sources. For corporate customers, any changes in ownership structure,
directorship, authorized signatories, or beneficial ownership must be reported
within thirty days. Customers must cooperate with periodic KYC update requests
and submit updated documents before expiry of existing documents. Submission of
false information or forged documents constitutes fraud and may result in
account closure, legal action, and reporting to authorities. Customers
designated as PEPs must disclose their status and provide additional
documentation regarding source of wealth and transaction patterns.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall verify customer identity through robust processes including
document verification, biometric authentication, and database checks where
available. The Bank will maintain a risk-based approach, categorizing customers
into low, medium, and high-risk profiles based on occupation, transaction
patterns, geographic location, and other factors. Physical verification of
address may be conducted for high-risk customers or large deposit relationships.
The Bank shall maintain centralized KYC records accessible across all branches
and departments for consistent customer service. Customer information is
securely stored with restricted access and protected against unauthorized
disclosure or data breaches. The Bank will send KYC update reminders to
customers before document expiry and provide convenient update channels
including digital document upload. Accounts with pending KYC updates beyond
grace periods will have partial restrictions on high-value transactions until
compliance is achieved. The Bank shall conduct periodic staff training on KYC
procedures, red flag identification, and customer sensitization.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Simplified due diligence may be applied for low-risk customers such as
government employees, senior citizens with pension accounts, or accounts with
low balances and transaction volumes, subject to regulatory approval. Walk-in
customers for remittances or forex transactions must complete KYC as per
transaction value thresholds even without account opening. Non-resident
customers require additional documentation including visa, work permit, overseas
address proof, and source of funds declaration. For customers unable to provide
standard address proof, the Bank may accept alternative documents such as
attestation from local government officials or employer certificates with proper
verification. The Bank reserves the right to request additional information or
documents beyond standard KYC requirements based on risk assessment. Digital KYC
through video verification and e-document submission is permitted for standard
accounts subject to regulatory guidelines. Accounts opened through digital
channels may have initial transaction limits until physical KYC completion.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan KYC/AML regulations, Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, and international best practices. The
KYC framework is reviewed annually and updated immediately upon regulatory
changes. Internal audits of KYC processes are conducted quarterly with sample
verification of customer documentation and risk categorization accuracy.
Technology solutions for KYC management, document verification, and risk scoring
are continuously upgraded to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Customer
complaints regarding KYC procedures are analyzed to identify and eliminate
unnecessary friction while maintaining compliance. The Bank maintains audit
trails of all KYC verifications, updates, and risk assessments for regulatory
inspection. Periodic reports on KYC compliance statistics, pending updates, and
high-risk customer management are submitted to regulatory authorities and senior
management.
2.2 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes Amanah Bank's framework for detecting, preventing, and
reporting money laundering and terrorist financing activities to protect the
financial system's integrity. It ensures compliance with national and
international AML/CFT regulations while safeguarding the Bank from being used as
a conduit for illicit funds. The policy aims to create a culture of vigilance
and accountability across all levels of the organization.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all products, services, transactions, and customer
relationships across Amanah Bank's operations. It covers domestic and
international transactions, cash and non-cash transactions, one-time customers,
account holders, and beneficial owners of legal entities. The policy governs
transaction monitoring, suspicious activity detection, reporting obligations,
customer risk assessment, sanctions screening, and employee training. It applies
to all employees, officers, directors, and third-party agents acting on behalf
of the Bank.
3. Definitions
Money Laundering: Process of concealing illicit funds' origin through complex
transactions to make them appear legitimate. Terrorist Financing: Providing,
collecting, or using funds with intention to support terrorist activities.
Suspicious Transaction: Transaction inconsistent with customer profile, having
no economic rationale, or involving potential illegal activities. Suspicious
Transaction Report (STR): Regulatory report filed for transactions suspected to
involve money laundering or terrorist financing. Designated Lists: Lists of
individuals and entities subject to sanctions by UN, FATF, or national
authorities. Tipping Off: Informing a customer that they are subject to
investigation or that an STR has been filed.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank maintains a zero-tolerance approach toward money laundering and
terrorist financing and will not knowingly facilitate such activities. The Bank
implements risk-based AML/CFT controls proportionate to identified money
laundering and terrorist financing risks. All employees are responsible for
identifying and reporting suspicious transactions regardless of amount, and the
Bank protects whistle-blowers from retaliation. Customer and transaction
screening against designated lists is mandatory before account opening and on an
ongoing basis. Cash transactions exceeding regulatory thresholds are reported to
the Financial Monitoring Unit as per statutory requirements. The Bank conducts
enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, products, and geographies prone
to money laundering risks. Suspicious Transaction Reports are filed within the
prescribed timeline to regulatory authorities, and tipping off customers is
strictly prohibited. The Bank cooperates fully with law enforcement and
regulatory authorities in AML/CFT investigations. Employees violating AML/CFT
policies face disciplinary action including termination, and the Bank may report
employee misconduct to authorities.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide truthful information about transaction purposes, fund
sources, and beneficial ownership when requested by the Bank. Customers should
conduct transactions consistent with their stated business or occupation and
inform the Bank of significant changes. Customers must not use Amanah Bank
accounts to receive, transfer, or facilitate funds related to illegal
activities. Structuring transactions to avoid reporting thresholds (smurfing) is
prohibited and will result in account closure and regulatory reporting.
Customers must cooperate with the Bank's due diligence inquiries and provide
supporting documentation for large or unusual transactions. Refusal to provide
information or documentation for legitimate AML/CFT compliance may result in
transaction decline or account closure. Customers should be aware that the Bank
has legal obligations to report suspicious transactions without informing the
customer.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall implement automated transaction monitoring systems to detect
unusual patterns, rapid fund movements, and transactions inconsistent with
customer profiles. The Bank will screen all customers and transactions against
designated lists including UN sanctions lists, FATF lists, and domestic
watchlists in real-time. A dedicated AML/CFT compliance unit shall investigate
alerts, conduct deeper analysis, and file Suspicious Transaction Reports when
required. The Bank will maintain detailed transaction records, customer
communications, and investigation files for at least seven years as per
regulatory requirements. All currency transactions exceeding PKR 1,000,000 in a
day are reported to authorities through Currency Transaction Reports (CTR). The
Bank shall conduct annual AML/CFT risk assessments to identify emerging threats,
vulnerabilities, and update controls accordingly. Mandatory AML/CFT training is
provided to all employees at onboarding and annually thereafter, with
specialized training for high-risk departments. The Bank shall decline
transactions or relationships that cannot be adequately risk-assessed or that
pose unacceptable money laundering risks.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
The Bank cannot disclose to customers that an STR has been filed or that they
are under investigation due to legal restrictions on tipping off. Customers may
experience transaction delays or additional documentation requests as part of
AML/CFT due diligence, which are mandatory compliance requirements. High-risk
customer categories including PEPs, non-residents, and high-value transactors
are subject to enhanced monitoring and periodic reviews, which may result in
occasional transaction delays. The Bank may freeze accounts or decline
transactions based on sanctions screening matches pending verification, which
may cause temporary inconvenience. Correspondent banks and payment service
providers may request additional information about Amanah Bank customers'
transactions for their own AML compliance. The Bank is legally obligated to
cooperate with law enforcement agencies and may provide customer information
pursuant to court orders or statutory requests without customer consent.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with the Anti-Money Laundering Act, Anti-Terrorism Act,
State Bank of Pakistan AML/CFT regulations, and Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) recommendations. The AML/CFT framework is subject to annual internal
audits and periodic reviews by external consultants to assess effectiveness.
Technology systems for transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and STR
management are upgraded regularly to adapt to evolving threats. The policy is
reviewed annually or immediately upon regulatory changes, emerging threats, or
deficiencies identified through audits. AML/CFT compliance statistics including
STRs filed, CTRs submitted, accounts closed, and training completion rates are
reported monthly to senior management. The Bank maintains membership in industry
forums to share typologies, trends, and best practices in combating financial
crime. Independent effectiveness reviews of the AML/CFT program are conducted
every three years by qualified external experts.
2.3 Customer Risk Assessment and Profiling Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes a systematic approach for assessing and categorizing
customers based on money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud risks. It
enables Amanah Bank to apply proportionate due diligence measures and monitoring
intensity based on risk profiles. The policy aims to optimize compliance
resources while enhancing detection of genuinely high-risk relationships and
transactions.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customers including individuals, businesses, non-
profit organizations, and other entities maintaining relationships with Amanah
Bank. It covers initial risk assessment at onboarding, ongoing risk scoring
through transaction behavior analysis, periodic risk review, and dynamic risk
re-categorization. The policy governs risk factors, scoring methodologies, risk
categories (low, medium, high), and corresponding control measures. It applies
across all products including deposits, loans, payments, remittances, and
investment services.
3. Definitions
Customer Risk Assessment: Evaluation process to determine money laundering,
terrorist financing, and fraud risks associated with a customer. Risk Score:
Numerical value indicating customer's overall risk level based on multiple risk
factors. Risk Category: Classification of customers into low, medium, or high-
risk segments for differential treatment. Risk Factors: Variables influencing
customer risk including occupation, income, transaction patterns, geography,
product usage, and channel preferences. Dynamic Risk Profiling: Continuous risk
assessment that adjusts customer risk scores based on behavior changes. Risk
Appetite: Maximum level of risk the Bank is willing to accept for customer
relationships.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank adopts a risk-based approach to customer due diligence, applying
enhanced scrutiny to higher-risk relationships while enabling smoother
experiences for low-risk customers. All customers are assigned risk scores at
onboarding based on occupation, income sources, geographic location, product
preferences, anticipated transaction patterns, and other relevant factors. Risk
assessments are conducted using a standardized scoring model approved by the
Bank's Compliance and Risk Management Committees. Customers are categorized as
low risk (score 0-30), medium risk (score 31-60), or high risk (score 61-100)
with corresponding due diligence and monitoring measures. High-risk customers
include PEPs, non-residents, cash-intensive businesses, money services
businesses, non-profit organizations, and customers from high-risk
jurisdictions. Customer risk profiles are dynamically updated based on
transaction behavior, account activity changes, adverse media reports, and
periodic reviews. The Bank may decline relationships that exceed its risk
appetite or where risks cannot be adequately mitigated. Risk assessments are
confidential and used solely for compliance and risk management purposes.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate information about occupation, income sources,
business nature, and anticipated transaction patterns to enable proper risk
assessment. Customers should inform the Bank of significant life changes such as
new employment, business expansion, inheritance, or international relocations
that may affect risk profiles. High-risk category customers must cooperate with
enhanced due diligence requirements including source of wealth documentation and
periodic account reviews. Customers should maintain transaction patterns
consistent with their declared profiles; significant deviations may trigger
additional verification requirements. Customers are responsible for
understanding that risk categorization may result in differential account
features, transaction limits, or approval requirements. Providing false or
misleading information to obtain lower risk classification constitutes fraud and
may result in account closure and regulatory reporting.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall apply consistent risk assessment methodologies across all
channels ensuring fair and non-discriminatory evaluation of
customersRetrySMContinue6. Bank Responsibilities (continued)
Amanah Bank shall apply consistent risk assessment methodologies across all
channels ensuring fair and non-discriminatory evaluation of customers. The Bank
will clearly communicate to customers when enhanced due diligence is required
due to high-risk classification without disclosing specific risk scores. Risk
assessment models are calibrated annually using historical data, regulatory
guidance, and industry best practices to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
Automated transaction monitoring systems are configured with risk-based
thresholds, applying stricter surveillance to high-risk customers while
minimizing false alerts for low-risk segments. The Bank shall conduct periodic
reviews of customer risk profiles at least annually for high-risk customers and
biennially for medium-risk customers. Low-risk customers undergo risk reviews
every three years or upon significant account behavior changes. The Bank
maintains detailed documentation of risk assessment rationale, supporting
evidence, and approval authorities for audit and regulatory inspection. Customer
service staff are trained to handle high-risk customer inquiries sensitively
without revealing risk scores or creating discrimination.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Risk scores and specific risk categorizations are confidential Bank information
and are not disclosed to customers to prevent gaming of risk assessment systems.
However, customers have the right to understand why additional documentation or
enhanced due diligence is requested. Certain customer segments may be assigned
minimum risk categories regardless of individual profiles; for example, all PEPs
are categorized as high-risk irrespective of other favorable factors. Geographic
risk factors are based on FATF high-risk jurisdictions, UN sanctions lists, and
national risk assessments, which may result in customers from certain countries
receiving higher risk scores. The Bank may apply temporary risk elevation to
customers involved in negative media reports, legal disputes, or regulatory
investigations pending clarification. Risk-based transaction limits and approval
requirements may cause operational differences between customers, which is a
regulatory compliance requirement rather than service discrimination. Customers
can request internal review of their risk classification if they believe errors
exist in the assessment, subject to provision of supporting documentation.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan risk-based supervision
guidelines, FATF risk assessment methodologies, and Basel Committee
recommendations on customer due diligence. The risk assessment model is
independently validated annually by internal audit and reviewed by external
auditors during statutory audits. The policy is updated annually or upon
significant changes in regulatory expectations, threat landscape, or Bank's risk
appetite. Customer risk distribution statistics (percentage in each risk
category) are reported quarterly to the Board Risk Committee and senior
management. Machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies are
evaluated periodically to enhance risk prediction accuracy and reduce false
positives. Customer complaints regarding risk-based treatment are analyzed to
ensure risk measures are proportionate and non-discriminatory. The Bank
participates in industry forums to benchmark risk assessment practices and share
intelligence on emerging risk typologies.
Category 3: Payment and Transaction Handling Policies
3.1 Domestic Payment and Transfer Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for processing domestic fund
transfers, bill payments, and other payment transactions executed by Amanah Bank
customers. It ensures secure, timely, and accurate payment processing while
protecting customers from fraud and operational errors. The policy aims to
provide convenient payment options while maintaining robust controls and
regulatory compliance.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all domestic payment transactions including inter-bank
fund transfers (IBFT), intra-bank transfers, Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
transactions, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, bill payments,
standing instructions, and scheduled payments. It covers payments initiated
through branches, ATMs, internet banking, mobile banking, telephone banking, and
point-of-sale terminals. The policy governs transaction authorization,
processing timelines, fees, transaction limits, error resolution, and fraud
prevention measures. It excludes international remittances and foreign exchange
transactions which are covered under separate policies.
3. Definitions
Domestic Payment: Fund transfer within Pakistan between Amanah Bank accounts or
to accounts at other banks. Inter-Bank Fund Transfer (IBFT): Electronic transfer
from Amanah Bank account to an account at another bank through the national
payment network. Intra-Bank Transfer: Transfer between two Amanah Bank accounts
processed instantly. Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS): High-value same-day
transfer system for amounts typically exceeding PKR 100,000. Standing
Instruction: Pre-authorized recurring payment instruction for regular bills or
transfers. Cut-off Time: Deadline for same-day processing of payment
transactions. Value Date: Date when transferred funds become available in the
beneficiary account.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank commits to processing domestic payments accurately, securely, and
within regulatory timelines to facilitate seamless fund movement for customers.
Intra-bank transfers between Amanah Bank accounts are processed instantly 24/7
with immediate availability of funds to beneficiaries. Inter-bank transfers
(IBFT) submitted before 5:00 PM are processed the same business day with funds
typically available to beneficiaries within 30 minutes during banking hours.
RTGS transfers submitted before 3:00 PM are processed the same day with
immediate settlement; transactions after cut-off time are processed the next
business day. Customers must ensure sufficient funds in their accounts before
initiating payments; insufficient balance transactions are declined or may incur
overdraft charges if applicable. Transaction limits apply based on channel
security levels with higher limits for branch transactions and lower limits for
digital channels, which can be customized per customer request. The Bank
verifies beneficiary account details including account number and title before
processing to minimize payment errors, though ultimate responsibility for
correct beneficiary information rests with the customer. All payment
instructions are irrevocable once processed; however, the Bank will make
reasonable efforts to recall erroneously sent payments if notified immediately.
Customers are required to review transaction confirmations and report
discrepancies within 24 hours for digital transactions and 7 days for branch
transactions.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must verify beneficiary account details including bank name, branch,
account number, and account title before initiating payments to prevent
misdirected transfers. Sufficient account balance or available credit limit must
be maintained before authorizing payments; customers are liable for overdraft
charges if payments cause negative balances. Customers using digital channels
must safeguard login credentials, transaction PINs, and OTP codes; sharing
credentials with others may result in liability for unauthorized transactions.
Any unauthorized transactions must be reported immediately to the Bank's 24/7
helpline to enable fraud investigation and potential recovery actions. Customers
should retain transaction confirmations, reference numbers, and receipts as
proof of payment for reconciliation and dispute resolution purposes. Standing
instructions for recurring payments must be updated or cancelled at least three
business days before the next scheduled payment date. Customers are responsible
for ensuring that payment purposes comply with legal and regulatory
requirements; the Bank may decline payments suspected to be for illegal
purposes. For high-value transactions exceeding PKR 500,000, customers may be
required to provide supporting documentation or source of funds information as
per AML/CFT requirements.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall process payment instructions in the sequence received,
adhering to established cut-off times and service level agreements for each
payment channel. The Bank will provide immediate confirmation for successful
payments including unique transaction reference numbers for tracking and dispute
resolution. Failed transactions due to technical issues, beneficiary account
problems, or network downtime are communicated to customers immediately with
clear explanation and resolution timelines. The Bank maintains 24/7 transaction
monitoring systems to detect fraud patterns, duplicate payments, and suspicious
activities, intervening when necessary to protect customers. Customers are
alerted through SMS, email, or app notifications for all debit transactions
above PKR 10,000 to enable immediate fraud detection. The Bank shall maintain
detailed transaction logs including timestamps, IP addresses, device
information, and authorization records for audit and dispute investigation
purposes. In cases of payment errors caused by Bank systems or staff, the Bank
will rectify the error immediately and compensate customers for any financial
losses including lost interest or penalty charges. The Bank provides multiple
customer service channels including helpline, email, and branch support to
address payment-related queries and complaints within specified response
timelines.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Transaction limits vary by channel: branch transactions up to PKR 5,000,000 per
day, internet banking up to PKR 500,000 per day, mobile banking up to PKR
200,000 per day, subject to customer-specific customization requests. These
limits are subject to periodic review and may be temporarily reduced during
security threats. Same-day processing cut-off times are strictly enforced;
transactions submitted after cut-off are processed the next business day
regardless of urgency, except for emergency situations with senior management
approval. The Bank is not liable for delays caused by beneficiary bank systems,
national payment network issues, or circumstances beyond the Bank's control;
however, reasonable efforts are made to expedite processing. Payments to new
beneficiaries may undergo additional verification procedures including cool-off
periods or phone confirmations to prevent fraud, causing processing delays. The
Bank reserves the right to decline payment instructions without assigning
reasons if transactions trigger AML/CFT alerts, sanctions screening hits, or
fraud detection systems. Charges for payment services are as per the published
fee schedule and may vary based on transaction value, urgency, and channel used;
fee waivers may apply for premium account holders or promotional periods.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan payment system regulations,
electronic fund transfer guidelines, and consumer protection directives
governing payment services. Payment processing systems undergo annual external
audits to verify security controls, transaction accuracy, and disaster recovery
capabilities. The policy is reviewed semi-annually to incorporate technological
advancements, regulatory changes, and customer experience improvements.
Transaction success rates, processing times, and customer complaints are
monitored through daily dashboards with escalation mechanisms for service
degradation. Customer disputes regarding payment transactions are tracked with
root cause analysis to identify systemic issues requiring policy or system
modifications. Staff training on payment products, fraud detection, and customer
service protocols is conducted quarterly with certification requirements for
operations personnel. The Bank maintains comprehensive business continuity plans
ensuring alternative payment processing capabilities during system outages or
disasters.
3.2 Cheque Handling and Clearing Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for issuing, depositing, clearing, and
managing cheques to ensure secure, efficient processing while preventing fraud
and financial losses. It aims to balance the convenience of cheque transactions
with necessary security controls and regulatory requirements. The policy
protects both cheque issuers and beneficiaries while gradually encouraging
migration to electronic payment alternatives.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all cheque books issued by Amanah Bank, cheques deposited
for collection, cheque clearing processes, and dishonored cheque handling. It
covers personal cheques, corporate cheques, pay orders, demand drafts, and
banker's cheques. The policy governs cheque book issuance procedures, deposit
methods (branch, ATM, mobile), clearing timelines, stop payment instructions,
and dishonor reasons and consequences. It applies to local cheques within the
clearing zone and outstation cheques requiring longer clearing periods.
3. Definitions
Cheque: Written instruction by account holder directing the Bank to pay
specified amount to the bearer or named beneficiary. Cheque Clearing: Process of
presenting cheques to drawee banks for payment and settling inter-bank
obligations. Dishonored Cheque: Cheque returned unpaid due to insufficient
funds, signature mismatch, or other irregularities. Stop Payment: Customer
instruction to the Bank not to honor a specific cheque. Clearing Cycle: Time
period from cheque deposit to funds availability in beneficiary account.
Truncated Cheque: Cheque converted to electronic image for clearing rather than
physical movement. Account Payee Cheque: Cheque marked to be deposited only in
payee's bank account, not encashable over the counter.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank provides cheque facilities to account holders as a traditional
payment instrument while encouraging adoption of faster electronic payment
methods. Cheque books are issued only to account holders maintaining
satisfactory account conduct with no history of cheque dishonor or fraudulent
activities. Standard cheque books contain 25 leaves with adequate security
features including watermarks, micro-printing, and UV ink to prevent
counterfeiting. Local cheques deposited before 2:00 PM on business days are
cleared within 24 hours with funds available by the next business day; deposits
after cut-off time are processed the following day. Outstation cheques require
7-10 business days for clearing depending on the drawee bank location and
correspondent banking arrangements. Cheques presented over six months from the
date of issuance are considered stale and will not be honored unless revalidated
by the drawer. The Bank employs image-based cheque truncation systems where
available to expedite clearing and reduce operational costs and risks. Post-
dated cheques presented before the mentioned date are returned; however, the
Bank advises against issuing post-dated cheques as they create legal and
operational complications. Customers are liable for all valid cheques drawn on
their accounts regardless of whether cheques were lost or stolen, unless timely
stop payment instructions were issued.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must safeguard cheque books securely and immediately report loss or
theft to the Bank to prevent fraudulent usage; the Bank is not liable for
cheques encashed before stop payment instructions are recorded. Cheques must be
written clearly in permanent ink with no overwriting or corrections; amount in
words and figures must match, and signature must correspond to specimen
signatures on record. Customers issuing cheques are responsible for maintaining
sufficient balance until cheque clearing; dishonored cheques may result in
penalties, account restrictions, and legal consequences. When depositing
cheques, customers must endorse the reverse side with signature and account
number; endorsements should match account holder name to prevent fraud.
Customers should verify cheque deposits through account statements and report
any missing credits within 30 days to enable investigation and recovery. Stop
payment requests must be submitted in writing with complete cheque details
including cheque number, date, amount, and payee name at least 24 hours before
anticipated presentation. Customers receiving dishonored cheques should promptly
represent them or pursue legal recourse as per negotiable instruments
regulations; representing beyond reasonable timeframes may weaken legal claims.
Corporate customers issuing high volumes of cheques should implement dual
signatory controls and reconcile issued versus presented cheques regularly.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall issue cheque books within three business days of request,
ensuring adequate security features and verification of requestor's identity and
authorization. The Bank will inspect deposited cheques for validity including
signature verification, date checks, alterations detection, and clearing zone
determination before accepting for collection. Image-based clearing systems are
utilized wherever possible to provide faster fund availability and reduce
physical instrument handling risks. Cheques deposited through ATMs or mobile
channels undergo additional verification, and provisional credit may be provided
subject to final clearing confirmation. The Bank shall immediately act on stop
payment instructions received with complete information, blocking cheque
presentation and returning if presented subsequently. Dishonored cheques are
promptly returned to depositing customers with clear reason codes including
"insufficient funds," "signature mismatch," "account closed," or other specific
reasons. The Bank maintains comprehensive audit trails of all cheque
transactions including images, clearing records, and dishonor reasons for
dispute resolution and regulatory compliance. Customers are alerted through SMS
or email when cheques are dishonored or when unusually large cheques are
presented against their accounts. The Bank provides special collection services
for high-value cheques with expedited clearing and guaranteed fund availability
for premium customers at applicable charges.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Cheque clearing timelines are subject to drawee bank processes, clearing house
schedules, and holidays; the Bank provides estimated timelines but cannot
guarantee exact clearing dates. Funds from deposited cheques may be available
immediately or after clearing based on customer relationship, cheque amount, and
risk assessment; provisional credit policies vary. Cheque dishonor penalties as
per the published fee schedule apply to drawers; repeated dishonors may result
in cheque facility suspension, account closure, and reporting to credit bureaus.
The Bank may place holds on cheques exceeding certain thresholds or from high-
risk sources until clearing confirmation, which may cause temporary
inconvenience to depositors. Stop payment services are provided on a best-effort
basis; if a cheque is presented and cleared before stop payment instructions are
processed, the Bank is not liable for the payment. Cheques with material
alterations, cutting, or overwriting are liable to be dishonored even if changes
appear to be authenticated; customers should issue fresh cheques rather than
correcting errors. Legal action against dishonored cheques is the payee's
responsibility; the Bank does not pursue legal cases on behalf of depositors
though cooperation is provided in legal proceedings.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy adheres to State Bank of Pakistan cheque clearing regulations,
Negotiable Instruments Act, cheque truncation system guidelines, and banker-
customer relationship principles. Cheque processing systems undergo quarterly
audits to verify signature verification accuracy, fraud detection effectiveness,
and clearing timeline compliance. The policy is reviewed annually with focus on
fraud prevention enhancements, clearing efficiency improvements, and customer
education on electronic payment alternatives. Cheque dishonor rates, fraud
incidents, and clearing delays are monitored through management dashboards with
corrective actions for anomalies. Customer complaints regarding delayed
clearing, wrongful dishonors, or processing errors are investigated within 5
business days with compensation for Bank errors. Staff training on cheque
security features, signature verification techniques, and fraud typologies is
conducted semi-annually with competency assessments. The Bank collaborates with
clearing houses and other banks to enhance cheque truncation adoption, fraud
intelligence sharing, and standardization of clearing practices.
3.3 Transaction Dispute Resolution Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes procedures for customers to dispute payment
transactions, report unauthorized activities, and seek resolution of transaction
errors or frauds. It ensures fair, transparent, and timely handling of disputes
while protecting both customer interests and Bank's operational integrity. The
policy aims to build customer trust through responsive complaint management and
appropriate liability allocation.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all payment transaction disputes including unauthorized
debits, incorrect transaction amounts, processing errors, duplicate charges,
failed transactions with debit, merchant disputes, ATM discrepancies, and fraud-
related claims. It covers transactions across all channels including branches,
ATMs, internet banking, mobile banking, POS terminals, and e-commerce platforms.
The policy governs dispute reporting timelines, investigation procedures,
provisional credit policies, liability determination, and resolution
communication. It excludes disputes related to loans, credit cards, and
investment products which are governed by specific product policies.
3. Definitions
Transaction Dispute: Customer claim that a transaction was unauthorized,
erroneous, or fraudulent. Unauthorized Transaction: Transaction not initiated or
approved by the customer or authorized user. Provisional Credit: Temporary
credit provided to customer during dispute investigation, subject to reversal if
dispute is not substantiated. Chargeback: Process of reversing a card
transaction and returning funds to cardholder, typically for merchant disputes
or fraud. Fraud: Intentional deception to secure unfair financial gain through
unauthorized access or false claims. Dispute Window: Time period within which
customers can report disputes for investigation and potential resolution. Good
Faith Claim: Dispute reported with honest belief of error or fraud without
intention to defraud the Bank.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank is committed to addressing transaction disputes promptly and fairly,
protecting customers from unauthorized transactions while preventing fraudulent
claims. Customers must report disputed transactions within 60 days of the
transaction date or statement date, whichever is earlier; claims beyond this
period may not be entertained except in exceptional circumstances. Disputes can
be reported through multiple channels including 24/7 helpline, email, mobile
app, internet banking, or by visiting any branch with supporting documentation.
Upon receiving a dispute, the Bank assigns a unique reference number and
initiates investigation involving transaction log analysis, system audit,
merchant verification, or communication with other banks. For unauthorized
transaction claims reported within 3 days, the Bank provides provisional credit
within 10 business days while investigation continues, provided the claim meets
good faith criteria. Final resolution is communicated within 30 days for most
disputes and 90 days for complex cases involving multiple parties or
international networks. If investigation confirms error or fraud caused by Bank
systems, merchants, or third parties, the customer is fully compensated
including any consequential charges like overdraft fees. If investigation
reveals customer negligence such as sharing credentials, delayed reporting, or
failure to maintain security, liability may be partially or fully assigned to
the customer. The Bank may prosecute customers making false or fraudulent
dispute claims, and such customers may face account closure and legal action.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must monitor account transactions regularly through statements,
internet banking, or mobile app and report discrepancies immediately upon
discovery. Disputed transactions should be reported as soon as possible within
the 60-day window; delayed reporting weakens investigation effectiveness and may
result in liability assignment to customer. When reporting disputes, customers
must provide complete information including transaction date, amount, merchant
name, reason for dispute, and any supporting evidence such as cancellation
confirmations or communications. Customers must preserve evidence related to
disputes including receipts, messages, emails, and refrain from physical
tampering with cards or documents. During investigation, customers should
cooperate by responding to Bank queries, providing additional documentation,
signing affidavits if required, and attending in-person meetings if necessary.
Customers must not simultaneously dispute transactions with merchants and the
Bank without informing both parties; double recovery attempts constitute fraud.
If provisional credit is provided, customers should use funds responsibly
understanding that reversal may occur if dispute is not substantiated. Customers
filing disputes in bad faith or making repeated false claims may face account
restrictions, closure, and legal consequences.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall acknowledge dispute reports immediately upon receipt and
provide unique reference numbers for tracking and follow-up purposes. The Bank
will investigate disputes objectively by reviewing transaction logs,
authentication records, IP addresses, device fingerprints, merchant responses,
and other relevant evidence. Customers are updated on investigation progress at
least every 10 days through SMS, email, or phone calls regarding case status.
Provisional credit is provided for qualifying unauthorized transaction claims
within 10 business days to minimize financial hardship during investigation. If
Bank systems, staff errors, or technical failures caused the disputed
transaction, the Bank immediately reverses the transaction and compensates for
consequential damages. The Bank maintains confidentiality of dispute information
and shares details only with parties directly involved in investigation such as
payment networks or correspondent banks. Final investigation outcomes with
detailed explanations are communicated in writing, including rationale for
liability determination and customer's rights to escalate if dissatisfied. The
Bank documents all disputes, investigations, and resolutions comprehensively for
audit purposes, regulatory compliance, and pattern analysis to prevent future
occurrences. Dispute trends are analyzed monthly to identify systemic issues,
fraud patterns, or process gaps requiring corrective actions.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
The 60-day dispute reporting window is strictly enforced except in cases of
serious illness, extended overseas travel, or other genuine circumstances
preventing timely reporting, which require documentary proof. Provisional credit
policies apply primarily to unauthorized transaction claims; other dispute types
such as merchant disputes or service quality issues may not receive provisional
credit. The Bank's maximum liability for unauthorized transactions is limited to
the account balance or transaction amount, whichever is lower, and does not
extend to indirect losses or consequential damages except where Bank negligence
is established. Disputes related to transactions authenticated with correct PIN,
password, or biometric verification face higher proof requirements as
authentication implies customer involvement. Customers sharing credentials,
writing down PINs, or failing to update security information may bear full
liability for resulting unauthorized transactions. Merchant disputes require
customers to first attempt resolution with merchants directly; the Bank
initiates chargebacks only if merchant resolution fails within reasonable
timeframes. International transaction disputes may take longer to resolve due to
multiple parties involved and different jurisdictions, potentially extending
beyond standard 30-day timelines.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan consumer protection guidelines,
electronic banking regulations, payment system directives, and card network
rules on dispute resolution. Dispute handling processes undergo semi-annual
audits to verify compliance with timelines, provisional credit policies, and
fair investigation practices. The policy is reviewed annually incorporating
regulatory updates, industry best practices, and learnings from dispute case
studies. Dispute resolution metrics including volumes, investigation timelines,
reversal rates, and customer satisfaction scores are reported monthly to senior
management. Customer complaints regarding dispute handling are escalated to the
Banking Mohtasib or regulatory authorities if not resolved satisfactorily within
Bank's internal grievance mechanism. Staff training on dispute investigation
techniques, fraud detection, evidence evaluation, and customer empathy is
conducted quarterly with scenario-based assessments. The Bank participates in
industry forums to share fraud intelligence, dispute trends, and collaborate on
reducing systemic vulnerabilities enabling unauthorized transactions.
Category 4: Card Issuance and Usage Policies
4.1 Debit Card Issuance and Management Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for issuing, managing, and
securing debit cards to enable convenient access to account funds while
protecting customers from fraud and unauthorized usage. It ensures customers
understand card features, fees, usage limits, and security responsibilities. The
policy aims to provide seamless payment experiences while maintaining robust
fraud prevention measures.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all debit cards issued by Amanah Bank linked to savings
or current accounts including domestic debit cards, international debit cards,
contactless cards, and virtual cards. It covers card issuance procedures,
activation requirements, PIN management, transaction limits, usage restrictions,
liability for unauthorized transactions, card blocking and replacement, and card
cancellation processes. The policy governs card usage at ATMs, POS terminals, e-
commerce platforms, and contactless payment scenarios across all geographies
where cards are enabled.
3. Definitions
Debit Card: Payment card linked to customer's bank account enabling ATM
withdrawals, POS purchases, and online transactions debited directly from the
account. Personal Identification Number (PIN): Secret numeric code known only to
cardholder for authenticating ATM and certain POS transactions. Card
Verification Value (CVV): Three-digit security code printed on card reverse used
for online and telephone transactions. Contactless Payment: Transaction
completed by tapping card near NFC-enabled terminal without PIN for small
amounts. Card Blocking: Temporary or permanent suspension of card to prevent
unauthorized usage. Chip and PIN: Security technology using embedded microchip
and PIN authentication for enhanced transaction security. Virtual Card: Card
number generated for online usage without physical card issuance.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank issues debit cards to account holders in good standing to provide
convenient 24/7 access to their funds for cash withdrawals and payments.
Standard debit cards are issued free of charge for primary account holders;
additional or replacement cards may incur fees as per the published schedule.
Debit cards are valid for three years from issuance and are automatically
renewed one month before expiry with new cards dispatched to registered
addresses. Cards must be activated within 30 days of receipt through ATM, phone
banking, or internet banking using the provided activation code; unactivated
cards are automatically cancelled. The default PIN is system-generated and
delivered separately from the card through secure courier; customers must change
PIN at first use for security. Transaction limits apply based on card type and
customer profile with standard daily limits of PKR 50,000 for ATM withdrawals
and PKR 200,000 for POS/online transactions, customizable upon request.
Customers are liable for all transactions authenticated with correct PIN until
the card is reported lost or stolen; post-reporting liability is limited to zero
for unauthorized transactions. The Bank employs real-time fraud detection
systems monitoring unusual transaction patterns, geographic anomalies, and high-
risk merchant categories, temporarily blocking cards when suspicious activity is
detected. Contactless transactions below PKR 5,000 do not require PIN;
cumulative contactless limits may trigger PIN requirements to maintain security.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must sign the signature panel on the card reverse immediately upon
receipt and activate cards through prescribed secure channels before usage. PINs
must be memorized and never written down, shared with others including family
members or bank staff, or stored electronically on phones or computers.
Customers should regularly monitor card transactions through SMS alerts, mobile
app notifications, and account statements, reporting unauthorized transactions
immediately. Lost, stolen, or compromised cards must be reported through 24/7
helpline immediately; any delay in reporting may result in customer liability
for unauthorized transactions during the delay period. Customers are responsible
for ensuring sufficient account balance before card transactions; insufficient
balance transactions are declined and may incur charges if the transaction
causes temporary overdraft. Cards should be used only at secure, reputable
merchants and ATMs; customers should inspect ATMs for skimming devices and
shield PIN entry from view. For online transactions, customers must verify
website authenticity, use secure networks, and never save CVV codes on e-
commerce platforms. Cards remain Bank property and must be surrendered upon
account closure, card blocking, or Bank's request; cutting cards in half before
disposal prevents fraudulent usage.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall issue debit cards within 10 business days of account opening
or card request, delivering cards and PINs through secure separate couriers to
registered addresses. The Bank will clearly communicate card features, fees,
transaction limits, and security best practices through welcome kits, website,
and mobile app. Real-time SMS and email alerts are sent for all card
transactions above PKR 1,000 enabling immediate fraud detection and reporting.
The Bank maintains 24/7 helpline for card blocking, complaint registration, and
emergency support particularly when customers are traveling. Fraud detection
systems monitor transactions continuously, temporarily blocking cards when
unusual patterns emerge and contacting customers for verification before
unblocking. Upon receiving lost or stolen card reports, the Bank immediately
blocks the card within 5 minutes preventing further unauthorized transactions.
Replacement cards are issued within 5 business days at applicable charges, with
emergency replacement options available for traveling customers. The Bank
investigates disputed card transactions thoroughly, providing provisional credit
where appropriate and reversing transactions proven to be fraudulent or
unauthorized. Card-related complaints are resolved within 15 business days with
regular status updates to customers.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Transaction limits are enforced per 24-hour rolling period; exceeding limits
results in transaction decline regardless of account balance. Limits can be
increased temporarily for travel or specific needs through phone banking or
branch requests. International usage is disabled by default for security;
customers must activate international transactions through mobile app or phone
banking before overseas travel. Merchant category blocks apply to certain high-
risk categories like gambling, adult content, or cryptocurrency exchanges; such
transactions are declined even within transaction limits. Contactless
transaction limits are regulatory-mandated and cannot be customized; cumulative
contactless transactions trigger PIN requirements per security protocols. The
Bank is not liable for transaction declines caused by technical issues with
merchant terminals, payment network downtime, or international transaction
restrictions. Cards may be blocked without notice if fraud is suspected,
excessive failed PIN attempts occur, or when accounts have legal attachments or
regulatory restrictions. Annual maintenance charges apply for premium
international debit cards as per fee schedule with charges debited quarterly to
linked accounts.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan regulations on payment cards,
international card network (Visa/Mastercard) rules, and consumer protection
directives for electronic banking. Card issuance and transaction processing
systems undergo annual PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
audits ensuring highest security standards. The policy is reviewed annually
incorporating technological advancements, emerging fraud patterns, and customer
feedback on card services. Card fraud rates, dispute volumes, and block-
replacement cycles are monitored through daily dashboards with immediate
escalation for unusual spikes. Customer complaints regarding card disputes,
unauthorized transactions, or service quality are analyzed monthly to identify
process improvements. Staff training on card products, fraud prevention, and
customer service protocols is conducted quarterly with certification
requirements for customer-facing employees. The Bank collaborates with payment
networks, law enforcement, and other banks to combat card fraud through
intelligence sharing and coordinated fraud prevention initiatives.
4.2 ATM Usage and Safety Policy
1. Purpose
This policy provides comprehensive guidelines for safe and effective use of
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) by Amanah Bank customers to prevent fraud,
ensure personal safety, and optimize ATM services. It establishes customer
responsibilities, Bank obligations, and security protocols governing ATM
transactions. The policy aims to maximize ATM convenience while minimizing
security risks and operational issues.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all ATM transactions including cash withdrawals, balance
inquiries, mini statements, PIN changes, and fund transfers conducted at Amanah
Bank's own ATMs and other banks' ATMs through shared networks. It covers ATM
card usage, transaction limits, fees, dispute resolution, safety precautions,
and liability for unauthorized withdrawals. The policy governs on-site ATMs
located at bank branches, off-site ATMs in public locations, and white-label
ATMs operated by third parties. It applies 24/7 across all ATM operational
hours.
3. Definitions
ATM (Automated Teller Machine): Electronic banking machine enabling customers to
perform financial transactions without teller assistance. On-Us ATM: ATM owned
and operated by Amanah Bank where customer transactions typically incur no fees.
Off-Us ATM: ATM owned by another bank accessed through shared payment networks
with applicable interchange fees. Skimming: Fraudulent practice of capturing
card data through devices installed on ATMs to create duplicate cards. Shoulder
Surfing: Theft technique where criminals observe customers entering PINs at
ATMs. Card Trapping: Fraud method where devices retain cards in ATMs to enable
theft. Failed Transaction: ATM transaction that doesn't complete successfully
but may debit customer account pending reversal.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank operates an extensive ATM network enabling 24/7 cash withdrawals,
balance inquiries, and basic banking services for customer convenience.
Transactions at Amanah Bank ATMs (on-us) are free of charge; transactions at
other banks' ATMs (off-us) may incur interchange fees as per the published
schedule with first two transactions monthly free. Daily ATM withdrawal limits
are set at PKR 50,000 for standard cards and PKR 100,000 for premium cards to
balance convenience with security. ATM transaction failures where accounts are
debited but cash is not dispensed are auto-reversed within 7 business days after
investigation; customers should report failures immediately for expedited
resolution. The Bank implements comprehensive ATM security measures including
CCTV surveillance, periodic security audits, anti-skimming devices, and customer
education programs. Customers are advised to use Amanah Bank's own ATMs
preferably for enhanced security and free transactions, especially in unfamiliar
locations. ATMs displaying signs of tampering, unusual attachments, or
suspicious behavior of nearby persons should be avoided, and such incidents
reported to Bank security. For personal safety, customers should avoid using
ATMs in isolated locations during late hours, keep cash discreetly after
withdrawal, and remain vigilant of surroundings. The Bank is liable for
unauthorized ATM withdrawals caused by technical failures or security breaches
proven to be beyond customer control, but not for losses due to customer
negligence.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must memorize ATM PINs and never write them on cards, store them in
wallets, or share with anyone including family members or individuals claiming
to be bank staff. Before inserting cards, customers should inspect ATMs for
unusual devices, card slot attachments, fake keypads, or camera installations
that may indicate skimming attempts. PIN entry should be shielded using the
other hand or body to prevent shoulder surfing or hidden cameras from capturing
PIN information. Cash should be counted immediately after withdrawal while still
at the ATM and reported immediately if the dispensed amount is incorrect.
Customers should not accept help from strangers at ATMs, particularly if cards
are retained or transactions fail; assistance should be sought from Bank's
helpline only. Transaction receipts should be properly stored or destroyed;
leaving receipts at ATM locations exposes account information to potential
fraudsters. If ATM retains the card, customers must immediately call the
helpline to block the card before leaving the location; retrieving retained
cards may take 2-3 business days through branch channels. Customers must report
lost or stolen ATM cards within one hour of discovery to minimize potential
liability for unauthorized withdrawals.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain ATMs in optimal working condition with regular cash
replenishment, currency note quality checks, and technical maintenance
schedules. ATM locations are chosen with security considerations including
adequate lighting, CCTV coverage, proximity to populated areas, and physical
securityRetrySMContinue6. Bank Responsibilities (continued)
ATM locations are chosen with security considerations including adequate
lighting, CCTV coverage, proximity to populated areas, and physical security
measures like security guards where feasible. The Bank shall install anti-
skimming devices, tamper-evident seals, and secure card readers on all ATMs with
quarterly inspections by security teams to detect any tampering attempts. CCTV
footage from ATMs is retained for 90 days to support dispute investigations,
fraud detection, and law enforcement requirements. ATM failure incidents where
cash is not dispensed but accounts are debited are investigated within 24 hours
with reversal processing initiated immediately upon confirmation. Customers are
alerted through SMS and email for all ATM withdrawals above PKR 10,000 enabling
immediate fraud detection and card blocking if unauthorized. The Bank provides
24/7 helpline support for ATM-related issues including card retention, failed
transactions, disputes, and emergency card blocking with dedicated ATM support
specialists. Periodic customer awareness campaigns are conducted through SMS,
email, app notifications, and branch posters educating about ATM safety,
skimming prevention, and secure banking practices. The Bank maintains strategic
partnerships with law enforcement agencies to combat ATM fraud through
surveillance data sharing, fraud intelligence, and joint investigations.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
ATM withdrawal limits are enforced strictly; attempting multiple withdrawals to
exceed daily limits results in transaction decline and potential temporary card
blocking for security. First two transactions at other banks' ATMs are free per
month; subsequent off-us transactions incur fees of PKR 15-25 per transaction as
per inter-bank agreements. ATM services may be temporarily unavailable during
scheduled maintenance windows typically conducted between 1:00 AM - 4:00 AM,
communicated through advance notices. Cash withdrawal denominations are subject
to ATM availability; the Bank strives to provide multiple denominations but
cannot guarantee specific note denominations. The Bank is not liable for ATM
withdrawal disputes if PIN entry is authenticated correctly and transaction logs
show normal processing without technical anomalies. Customers withdrawing
maximum daily limits at unfamiliar locations or during unusual hours may trigger
fraud alerts resulting in temporary card blocking requiring verification before
unblocking. ATMs located in remote or high-risk areas may have reduced cash
withdrawal limits or restricted operational hours for security reasons. Failed
transactions at third-party ATMs require coordination with host banks; reversal
timelines may extend to 15 days for off-us transaction failures.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy adheres to State Bank of Pakistan ATM operation guidelines, Payment
Systems and Electronic Fund Transfers Act, and security standards prescribed for
electronic banking channels. ATM security infrastructure including anti-skimming
devices, CCTV systems, and physical security measures undergoes quarterly audits
by internal security teams and annual external security assessments. The policy
is reviewed semi-annually incorporating emerging fraud techniques, technological
security enhancements, and customer feedback on ATM experiences. ATM
availability metrics, transaction success rates, dispute volumes, and fraud
incidents are monitored daily through centralized dashboards with immediate
escalation for anomalies. Customer complaints regarding ATM failures,
unauthorized withdrawals, or safety concerns are investigated within 5 business
days with resolution communication and compensation where applicable. Staff
training on ATM dispute resolution, fraud investigation techniques, and customer
communication protocols is conducted quarterly. The Bank invests continuously in
next-generation ATM technologies including biometric authentication, cardless
transactions, and advanced anti-fraud systems to enhance security and
convenience.
Category 5: Interest Rate and Deposit Policies
5.1 Savings Account Interest Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes transparent guidelines for calculating, crediting, and
disclosing interest on savings accounts to ensure fair compensation for customer
deposits while maintaining competitive rates. It aims to provide clear
understanding of interest computation methods, rate determination factors, and
tax implications. The policy ensures regulatory compliance while optimizing
returns for savers across different account types and balance tiers.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all savings account variants offered by Amanah Bank
including regular savings accounts, premium savings accounts, senior citizen
accounts, women's savings accounts, and children's savings accounts. It covers
interest rate determination, calculation methodologies, crediting frequencies,
minimum balance requirements for interest earning, and tax deduction procedures.
The policy governs rate revisions, customer notification procedures, and
disclosure requirements. It excludes fixed deposits and term deposits which have
separate interest policies based on maturity periods and investment amounts.
3. Definitions
Interest Rate: Annual percentage rate paid by the Bank on savings account
balances. Annual Percentage Yield (APY): Effective annual rate including
compounding effect. Minimum Balance: Threshold balance required to earn interest
on savings accounts. Average Daily Balance: Sum of daily closing balances
divided by days in the period, used for interest calculation. Tiered Interest:
Different interest rates applied to different balance slabs within the same
account. Withholding Tax: Tax deducted at source by the Bank on interest income
before crediting to accounts. Profit Rate: Return on Islamic savings accounts
calculated through profit-sharing rather than fixed interest.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank offers competitive interest rates on savings accounts determined
based on State Bank policy rates, market conditions, funding costs, and
competitive positioning, reviewed monthly by the Asset-Liability Committee.
Interest is calculated on the daily closing balance using the Average Daily
Balance method, ensuring customers earn proportionate returns regardless of
balance fluctuations during the month. Standard savings accounts earn interest
at rates ranging from 5% to 8% per annum based on balance tiers: PKR 0-50,000
earns 5% p.a., PKR 50,001-500,000 earns 6.5% p.a., and balances exceeding PKR
500,000 earn 8% p.a. Interest is compounded monthly and credited to accounts on
the last business day of each month, appearing in statements as "Interest
Credit" with clear rate and calculation details. Minimum balance of PKR 1,000
must be maintained throughout the month to qualify for interest; accounts
falling below this threshold earn zero interest for that month. Senior citizens
(above 60 years) receive preferential rates with an additional 0.5% premium over
standard rates recognizing their savings needs. Women's savings accounts and
children's accounts receive promotional rates typically 0.25%-0.5% higher than
standard accounts as part of financial inclusion initiatives. Interest income is
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates (currently 15% for filers and 30%
for non-filers) deducted at source before crediting, with annual tax
certificates provided for tax filing purposes. Rate changes are communicated
through multiple channels including website updates, mobile app notifications,
branch displays, and direct communication for rate reductions affecting existing
customers.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must maintain minimum balance of PKR 1,000 throughout the month to
earn interest; falling below this amount even briefly disqualifies the entire
month from interest earning. Customers should provide accurate National Tax
Number (NTN) or CNIC for proper tax status determination; failure to provide tax
information results in higher withholding tax deduction. Tax certificates issued
annually by the Bank must be included in personal tax returns; customers are
responsible for declaring interest income and reconciling with tax authorities.
Customers should monitor interest credits monthly through statements or digital
channels and report discrepancies within 30 days to enable investigation and
correction. Maintaining updated contact information ensures timely receipt of
interest rate change notifications, allowing customers to make informed
decisions about fund allocation. Customers dissatisfied with rate changes have
the right to close accounts and move funds to alternative investments without
penalties, maintaining financial autonomy. Senior citizens claiming preferential
rates must provide valid age proof through CNIC or birth certificate; false age
claims constitute fraud punishable under law.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall calculate interest accurately using the Average Daily Balance
method with automated systems ensuring error-free computation and timely monthly
crediting. The Bank will maintain transparent disclosure of current interest
rates through website, mobile app, branch displays, and customer service
channels with updates within 24 hours of rate revisions. Rate determination
follows documented methodology approved by senior management with considerations
including central bank policy rates, competitive landscape, and institutional
funding requirements. Customers are notified at least 15 days in advance of
interest rate reductions through SMS, email, or written communication, allowing
time for alternate arrangements if desired. Interest rate increases are
implemented immediately with retrospective application where feasible,
maximizing customer benefits without delay. The Bank shall deduct withholding
tax accurately based on customer's filer/non-filer status with proper tax code
application and quarterly reporting to Federal Board of Revenue. Annual tax
certificates detailing gross interest earned, tax deducted, and net interest
credited are provided by January 31st each year for preceding calendar year. The
Bank maintains detailed interest calculation worksheets, rate change approvals,
and customer notifications as audit evidence for regulatory compliance and
dispute resolution. Customer complaints regarding interest calculation errors or
rate application issues are investigated within 10 business days with immediate
correction and compensation including lost interest.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Interest rates are variable and subject to change based on economic conditions,
central bank policy changes, and competitive pressures; the Bank does not
guarantee rate stability. Promotional interest rates for new accounts or
specific campaigns have defined validity periods mentioned in promotional
materials; reverting to standard rates occurs automatically post-promotion.
Islamic savings accounts follow profit-sharing mechanisms instead of fixed
interest rates; profit rates fluctuate based on Bank's investment returns and
are declared monthly. Accounts with dormant status do not earn interest during
the dormancy period even if balances exceed minimum thresholds; interest resumes
upon reactivation. Staff accounts, related party accounts, and accounts with
special arrangements may have different interest rate structures governed by
internal policies or contractual agreements. Interest earned on balances below
PKR 10,000 may not be credited monthly but accumulated and credited quarterly to
optimize operational costs. Tax status changes during the year affect
withholding rates prospectively; customers must update tax status promptly to
avoid excess deductions.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan regulations on interest rates,
banking company ordinance provisions on deposit pricing, and tax laws governing
withholding tax deductions. Interest calculation systems undergo annual external
audits verifying accuracy, tax deduction correctness, and compliance with
approved rate structures. The policy is reviewed quarterly or immediately upon
State Bank policy rate changes, ensuring alignment with monetary policy
objectives and competitive positioning. Interest rate competitiveness analysis
is conducted monthly comparing rates against peer banks, with recommendations to
senior management for rate adjustments. Customer complaints regarding interest
calculations, tax deductions, or rate communications are tracked with root cause
analysis to identify systemic issues. Staff training on interest calculation
methodologies, tax regulations, and customer communication regarding rate
changes is conducted semi-annually. The Bank maintains comprehensive
documentation of rate revisions, justifications, approval authorities, and
customer communication records for regulatory inspection and audit purposes.
5.2 Fixed Deposit Account Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for fixed deposit accounts offering customers
higher interest returns in exchange for committed deposit periods, balancing
liquidity constraints with attractive yields. It ensures transparent disclosure
of terms, premature withdrawal consequences, and renewal options. The policy
aims to mobilize customer savings while providing predictable funding sources
for Bank's lending operations.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all fixed deposit products including standard term
deposits, special tenure deposits, senior citizen deposits, monthly income
deposits, and jumbo deposits offered by Amanah Bank. It covers tenure options
ranging from 1 month to 5 years, minimum deposit requirements, interest rate
structures, maturity procedures, premature withdrawal rules, and automatic
renewal options. The policy governs nomination facilities, loan against deposit
provisions, and tax treatment of fixed deposit interest. It applies to
individual and joint fixed deposits excluding corporate deposits governed by
treasury policies.
3. Definitions
Fixed Deposit (FD): Time-bound deposit with predetermined interest rate and
maturity date. Tenure: Committed deposit period ranging from 1 month to 5 years.
Maturity Date: Date when fixed deposit completes its tenure and becomes payable
with interest. Premature Withdrawal: Closing fixed deposit before maturity date
with interest penalty. Auto-Renewal: Automatic reinvestment of matured deposit
for same tenure at prevailing rates. Compounding Frequency: Periodic interval
(monthly/quarterly/annually) for interest capitalization. Cumulative Deposit: FD
where interest is compounded and paid at maturity. Non-Cumulative Deposit: FD
where interest is paid periodically (monthly/quarterly) rather than at maturity.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank offers fixed deposits with tenures from 1 month to 5 years providing
guaranteed returns ranging from 7% p.a. for 1-3 month deposits to 10% p.a. for
5-year deposits, with rates higher than savings accounts reflecting liquidity
premium. Minimum deposit amount is PKR 10,000 with no maximum limit; however,
jumbo deposits exceeding PKR 10 million may receive negotiated premium rates
subject to treasury approval. Interest rates are fixed at booking and remain
constant throughout the tenure regardless of subsequent market rate changes,
providing return certainty to depositors. Customers choose between cumulative
deposits where interest compounds and pays at maturity, or non-cumulative
deposits providing periodic interest payouts monthly or quarterly as per
preference. Senior citizens above 60 years receive preferential rates with
additional 0.5% premium across all tenures recognizing retirement income needs.
Premature withdrawal is permitted with penalty of 1-2% reduction from contracted
rate depending on actual holding period, discouraging early withdrawals while
retaining customer flexibility. Upon maturity, deposits auto-renew for the same
tenure at prevailing rates unless customers provide contrary instructions at
least 7 days before maturity; maturity alerts are sent 15 days in advance.
Customers can avail loans or overdrafts against fixed deposits up to 90% of
deposit value at preferential interest rates typically 2-3% above deposit rate,
providing liquidity without breaking deposits. Fixed deposit receipts are issued
as proof containing deposit amount, tenure, interest rate, maturity date, and
maturity value, serving as negotiable instruments transferable by endorsement.
Nomination facility is mandatory for fixed deposits enabling smooth transmission
to nominees upon depositor's death without legal complications.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must carefully evaluate liquidity needs before booking fixed deposits
as premature withdrawals attract penalties reducing effective returns
significantly. Deposit tenure selection should align with financial goals, cash
flow requirements, and interest rate expectations for optimal returns. Customers
must preserve fixed deposit receipts securely as they are valuable documents
required for maturity claims, premature withdrawals, or loan against deposit
applications. Maturity instructions including renewal preferences or fund
transfer details should be communicated at least 7 days before maturity date to
ensure smooth processing. Customers opting for auto-renewal should monitor rate
changes and evaluate if renewed rates meet return expectations; renewals can be
reversed within 7 days of maturity date if dissatisfied. For joint fixed
deposits, operating instructions (either or survivor/former or survivor/jointly)
must be clearly specified at booking to avoid disputes during maturity or
premature withdrawal. Customers must update nomination details upon life events
such as marriage, childbirth, or nominee's death to ensure intended
beneficiaries receive deposits. Tax documentation including National Tax Number
should be provided for accurate withholding tax deduction; updates to tax status
must be communicated promptly. Customers should verify maturity credits to
accounts within 5 business days of maturity date and report any delays or
discrepancies immediately.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall issue fixed deposit receipts immediately upon booking
containing all material terms including deposit amount, tenure, interest rate,
compounding frequency, maturity date, and maturity value prominently displayed.
The Bank will calculate maturity values accurately using specified interest
rates and compounding methods, with systems ensuring error-free computation.
Maturity alerts are sent 15 days before maturity through SMS, email, and phone
calls informing customers of impending maturity and renewal terms. Upon
maturity, if no contrary instructions exist, deposits auto-renew at prevailing
rates for same tenure with renewal confirmation sent to customers within 24
hours. Customers providing maturity instructions receive funds through their
chosen method (account credit, cheque, transfer) within 24 hours of maturity
date. Premature withdrawal requests are processed within 3 business days with
clear communication of penalty charges and net amount payable before processing
for customer confirmation. The Bank maintains detailed records of fixed deposit
bookings, rate cards applicable at booking dates, maturity registers, and
premature withdrawal approvals for audit and dispute resolution. Interest earned
is subject to withholding tax deducted at source with accurate tax certificates
provided annually detailing gross interest, tax deducted, and net interest.
Customer complaints regarding interest calculation errors, maturity processing
delays, or rate disputes are investigated within 7 business days with immediate
rectification where Bank errors are established.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Fixed deposit rates are subject to change for new bookings but existing deposits
retain contracted rates throughout tenure, insulating depositors from rate
reductions but forgoing benefits of rate increases. Jumbo deposits exceeding PKR
10 million receive special rates negotiated with treasury desk based on amount,
tenure, and relationship value; rate negotiations require senior management
approval. Staff deposits, related party deposits, and special relationship
deposits may have different rate structures, premature withdrawal terms, or
privileges governed by internal policies. Premature withdrawal within the first
month of booking attracts higher penalties (3-4% reduction) to discourage
immediate withdrawals post-booking. Fixed deposits can serve as collateral for
loans with 90% loan-to-value; however, deposits remain frozen until loan
repayment, restricting premature withdrawal or partial withdrawals. Auto-renewal
occurs at prevailing rates which may be lower than original booking rates during
falling rate environments, potentially disappointing customers expecting
original rates. Tax rates on fixed deposit interest apply as per tax laws with
higher rates for non-filers; customers are responsible for understanding tax
implications before investing. In cases of depositor death, transmission to
nominees requires legal documentation (death certificate, nominee
identification) processed within 15 business days of complete documentation
submission.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan deposit mobilization
guidelines, banking company ordinance provisions on fixed deposits, and
regulatory directives on nomination facilities. Fixed deposit systems undergo
annual audits verifying interest calculation accuracy, premature withdrawal
penalty applications, and maturity processing timelines. The policy is reviewed
semi-annually incorporating regulatory changes, competitive positioning
requirements, and customer feedback on deposit products. Fixed deposit portfolio
analytics including tenure distribution, premature withdrawal rates, and auto-
renewal percentages are monitored monthly to inform product and pricing
strategies. Customer complaints regarding fixed deposit terms, maturity
processing, or premature withdrawal penalties are analyzed quarterly to identify
policy refinements needed. Staff training on fixed deposit products, interest
calculation, premature withdrawal processing, and customer advisory is conducted
quarterly ensuring consistent service delivery. The Bank maintains comprehensive
documentation of rate cards, jumbo deposit negotiations, premature withdrawal
approvals, and exception cases for regulatory compliance and internal audits.
Category 6: Lending and Credit Policies
6.1 Personal Loan Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for evaluating, approving,
disbursing, and managing personal loans to enable customers to meet legitimate
financial needs while ensuring responsible lending and credit risk management.
It balances customer access to credit with prudent underwriting standards
protecting both borrower and Bank interests. The policy promotes financial
inclusion while maintaining asset quality and regulatory compliance.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all unsecured personal loans offered by Amanah Bank for
purposes including medical emergencies, education, marriage, home renovation,
debt consolidation, and other personal needs. It covers loan eligibility
criteria, documentation requirements, credit assessment procedures, loan amounts
and tenures, interest rates and charges, disbursement methods, repayment terms,
and default consequences. The policy governs salaried and self-employed
borrowers, co-borrower arrangements, and guarantor requirements. It excludes
secured loans (mortgage, auto), business loans, and credit cards which have
separate policies.
3. Definitions
Personal Loan: Unsecured credit facility for personal needs repaid through fixed
monthly installments. Principal Amount: Loan amount disbursed to borrower
excluding interest and charges. Equated Monthly Installment (EMI): Fixed monthly
repayment amount including principal and interest components. Tenure: Loan
repayment period ranging from 12 to 60 months. Annual Percentage Rate (APR):
Total borrowing cost including interest rate and charges expressed annually.
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Percentage of borrower's monthly income committed to
debt obligations. Credit Score: Numerical representation of borrower's
creditworthiness based on credit history. Default: Failure to make scheduled EMI
payment resulting in loan delinquency.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank offers personal loans ranging from PKR 50,000 to PKR 2,000,000 with
tenures from 1 to 5 years to help customers meet diverse financial needs
responsibly. Eligibility requires minimum age 21 years, maximum age 60 years at
loan maturity, minimum monthly income PKR 30,000 for salaried and PKR 50,000 for
self-employed, and minimum 6 months employment/business continuity. Loan amounts
are determined based on income multiples (maximum 10x monthly income) and debt-
to-income ratio (total monthly obligations should not exceed 50% of monthly
income including proposed loan). Interest rates range from 15% to 22% per annum
based on credit profile, income stability, employment sector, and relationship
with Bank, reviewed monthly aligned with policy rate changes. Processing fees of
1-2% of loan amount (minimum PKR 1,000) and documentation charges apply as per
fee schedule, collected upfront from loan disbursement reducing net proceeds.
Credit assessment includes verification of employment, income documentation,
credit bureau checks (minimum credit score 650), banking transaction analysis,
and reference checks to establish repayment capacity. Loan disbursement occurs
within 7 business days of approval through direct credit to borrower's Amanah
Bank account; accounts must be maintained throughout loan tenure for EMI
deductions. EMI auto-debit from salary accounts is mandatory for salaried
borrowers; insufficient balance EMI returns attract penalties and adverse credit
bureau reporting. Part-prepayment (minimum PKR 10,000) and foreclosure are
permitted after 6 months with charges of 3-5% on prepaid amount compensating
Bank for interest loss. Defaults trigger recovery proceedings including legal
action, asset attachment, guarantor liability invocation, and negative credit
bureau reporting affecting future creditworthiness.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate, complete, and verifiable information regarding
employment, income, existing obligations, and personal details during loan
application; false information constitutes fraud with criminal consequences.
Supporting documents including salary slips/bank statements (last 6 months),
employment letter, CNIC, utility bills, and existing loan statements must be
genuine originals; submission of forged documents leads to application rejection
and legal action. Customers should borrow amounts commensurate with genuine
needs and repayment capacity; over-borrowing creates financial stress and
default risks damaging creditworthiness. Loan proceeds must be used for stated
purposes; misuse for speculative investments, gambling, or illegal activities
violates loan terms and may trigger recall. Sufficient balance must be
maintained in auto-debit accounts on EMI due dates (typically salary credit
date); managing cash flows to ensure EMI payment is customer's responsibility.
Customers must promptly inform the Bank of employment changes, income
reductions, or financial difficulties enabling proactive restructuring rather
than defaults. Part-prepayment and foreclosure opportunities should be utilized
when surplus funds are available to reduce interest costs and complete
obligations early. Customers should preserve loan agreements, repayment
schedules, and payment receipts as proof of obligations and track loan closure
certificates upon full repayment.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall assess loan applications objectively within 5 business days
using standardized credit scoring models, income verification procedures, and
credit bureau checks ensuring consistent treatment. The Bank will clearly
disclose all loan terms including principal amount, interest rate, processing
fees, EMI amount, total interest payable, total repayment amount, and APR in
loan agreements and marketing materials. Loan agreements in simple language
highlighting key terms, prepayment provisions, default consequences, and
customer rights are provided with adequate time for review before signing.
Disbursement occurs only after customer acknowledgment of terms, completion of
documentation, and quality control verification of eligibility and
creditworthiness. The Bank shall send monthly loan statements detailing EMI
deducted, principal/interest bifurcation, outstanding balance, and next EMI due
date through SMS, email, or physical statements. Customers facing temporary
financial difficulties are offered restructuring options including EMI reduction
through tenure extension, moratorium periods, or interest rate adjustments
subject to eligibility. The Bank maintains transparent recovery processes
beginning with reminders for missed EMIs, progressing to default notices, and
legal action only as last resort after exhausting resolution attempts. Upon loan
closure, completion certificates are issued within 7 business days and positive
closure reported to credit bureaus enhancing customer credit profiles for future
borrowing.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Personal loans are unsecured facilities carrying higher interest rates than
secured loans reflecting credit risk; customers should compare options before
choosing personal loans over secured alternatives. Interest rates are floating
linked to Bank's base rate plus customer-specific spread; policy rate changes by
State Bank may cause EMI adjustments with prior notification. Processing fees
and documentation charges are non-refundable even if customers prepay or
foreclose loans; these cover upfront assessment and origination costs incurred
by Bank. Loan amounts for self-employed borrowers may be lower than salaried
borrowers at similar income levels due to income stability considerations and
verification challenges. Customers with existing Amanah Bank loans may face
cumulative exposure limits restricting additional borrowings regardless of
individual loan eligibility. Co-borrowers or guarantors improve loan eligibility
and amounts but undertake joint and several liability; all parties are equally
responsible for full loan repayment. Partial payments or payments less than EMI
amounts are not accepted; customers must pay full EMI to avoid default
classification and penalties. Loan insurance products may be offered to cover
EMI payments during unemployment, disability, or death; these are optional with
separate premiums not included in quoted interest rates.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan prudential regulations on
consumer financing, responsible lending guidelines, and Consumer Protection
departments directives on disclosure and fair practices. Loan origination
processes undergo quarterly audits verifying KYC compliance, income verification
adequacy, credit assessment consistency, and documentation completeness. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory changes, credit performance
analytics, and best practices in consumer lending. Loan portfolio quality
metrics including delinquency rates, default rates, and loss rates are monitored
monthly with early warning systems triggering underwriting criteria tightening
during deterioration. Customer complaints regarding loan rejections, interest
calculations, recovery practices, or service quality are analyzed monthly to
identify process improvements. Staff training on credit assessment, customer
interaction, responsible lending principles, and regulatory compliance is
conducted quarterly with competency certifications. The Bank maintains
comprehensive credit files including applications, assessments, approvals,
disbursement records, and repayment histories for regulatory inspection and
audit purposes.
6.2 Loan Recovery and Restructuring Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes fair, transparent, and legally compliant procedures for
recovering overdue loans while providing support mechanisms for customers facing
genuine financial difficulties. It balances Bank's obligation to protect
depositor funds with empathy toward borrowers in distress. The policy aims to
maximize recovery while maintaining customer dignity and exploring
rehabilitation before resorting to legal action.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all retail loans including personal loans, auto loans,
mortgage loans, and credit cards that become overdue or non-performing at Amanah
Bank. It covers early-stage collection procedures, restructuring options for
viable borrowers, write-off procedures for irrecoverable loans, legal recovery
processes, and asset liquidation. The policy governs communication protocols
with defaulting borrowers, third-party collection agency engagement, and
reporting to credit bureaus. It applies from first missed payment through final
resolution including legal proceedings and asset attachment.
3. Definitions
Overdue Loan: Loan with missed EMI payment beyond due date. Non-Performing Loan
(NPL): Loan overdue for 90 days or more classified as impaired asset.
Restructuring: Modification of loan terms including tenure extension, interest
rate reduction, or moratorium to assist distressed borrowers. Write-Off:
Accounting removal of uncollectible loan from balance sheet while continuing
recovery efforts. Recovery: Process of collecting overdue amounts through
voluntary repayment, asset liquidation, or legal proceedings. Guarantor: Third
party who undertakes legal obligation to repay loan if primary borrower
defaults. Collateral: Asset pledged as security for secured loans, subject to
attachment and sale during default.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank initiates recovery processes immediately upon EMI default, beginning
with courteous reminders escalating progressively based on delinquency duration
while maintaining respect and dignity toward customers. First missed EMI
triggers automated SMS and email reminders within 24 hours followed by phone
calls within 3 days to understand reasons and encourage immediate payment. Loans
overdue 30-60 days enter enhanced collection with dedicated relationship
managers engaging borrowers to understand difficulties and explore voluntary
resolution including part-payments or restructuring. Borrowers facing temporary
financial setbacks due to job loss, medical emergencies, business disruptions,
or natural calamities are offered restructuring options including tenure
extension (reducing EMI), moratorium periods (deferring payments), or interest
rate concessions subject to eligibility assessment. Restructuring requires
written application with supporting documents proving financial distress,
proposed repayment plan demonstrating recovery capacity, and may involve
additional security or guarantors. Loans overdue 90 days are classified as Non-
Performing Assets (NPA) with mandatory provisioning, credit bureau reporting as
default, and initiation of legal recovery proceedings unless restructuring is
approved. Legal notices are issued after 90 days default demanding full
outstanding amount with interest, penal charges, and recovery costs; non-
response within 30 days leads to civil suit filing for money recovery. For
secured loans, the Bank may invoke arbitration clauses, initiate foreclosure
proceedings, attach and auction pledged assets recovering dues from sale
proceeds with surplus returned to borrowers. Guarantors are pursued parallely to
primary borrowers with equal legal liability; guarantor harassment or undue
pressure is prohibited with professional communication standards maintained.
Third-party collection agencies may be engaged for overdue portfolios with
strict oversight ensuring compliance with ethical practices, customer privacy
protection, and prohibition of harassment tactics. Written-off loans remain
legally enforceable; the Bank continues recovery efforts indefinitely until full
recovery or legal time-barring, whichever earlier.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must prioritize loan EMI payments treating them as non-negotiable
obligations even during financial difficulties; proactive communication with
Bank before defaults enables better resolution options. Upon anticipating
payment difficulties, customers should immediately contact the Bank explaining
circumstances, providing financial information, and proposing feasible repayment
plans rather than avoiding communication. Customers must respond promptly to
Bank's collection calls, emails, and notices; avoiding contact creates
assumptions of willful default triggering aggressive recovery actions.
Supporting documentation for restructuring requests including income proof,
medical certificates, layoff letters, or business disruption evidence must be
genuine and submitted promptly. Customers must honor restructuring terms
committed including revised payment schedules, additional security deposits, or
guarantor arrangements; second defaults after restructuring lead to immediate
legal action. For secured loans, customers should maintain collateral assets in
good condition and refrain from encumbering or disposing them; collateral damage
or alienation constitutes breach enabling immediate recovery. Customers should
keep the Bank informed of address changes, contact number updates, and
employment status ensuring communication channels remain open throughout loan
tenure. Upon receiving legal notices, customers should seek immediate resolution
through settlement negotiations or legal representation; ignoring notices leads
to ex-parte decrees and asset attachment without hearing opportunities.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain professional, respectful communication during
recovery processes avoiding harassment, abusive language, threats, public
humiliation, or contact at unreasonable hours (before 7 AM or after 9 PM). The
Bank will genuinely evaluate restructuring requests from customers facing
verified financial hardships using standardized criteria, processing
applications within 15 business days with clear approval or rejection
communication. Restructuring terms are designed to balance customer
affordability with Bank's recovery objective; terms are clearly documented with
customer acknowledgment before implementation. The Bank shall maintain
confidentiality of customer financial difficulties and default status, sharing
information only with credit bureaus, legal authorities, or regulators as
legally mandated. Third-party collection agencies engaged by the Bank are
contractually bound to ethical practices; customer complaints regarding agency
behavior are investigated with agency termination for violations. The Bank
provides clear communication at each recovery stage including amount overdue,
penal charges, recovery costs, legal consequences, and resolution options
enabling informed customer decision-making. For secured loans, asset valuation
is conducted by independent appraisers before foreclosure ensuring fair pricing;
auction processes are transparent with adequate public notice. Surplus proceeds
from asset sales after recovering Bank dues, legal costs, and auction expenses
are promptly returned to borrowers within 30 days of sale completion. The Bank
maintains comprehensive records of all recovery communications, restructuring
decisions, legal proceedings, and asset sales for regulatory compliance and
customer dispute resolution.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Restructuring is a relief mechanism, not an entitlement; the Bank reserves
discretion to approve or reject restructuring based on credit assessment, past
conduct, and recovery prospects even with valid hardship. Restructured loans
attract higher interest rates (typically 2-3% premium) reflecting elevated
credit risk and extended recovery timelines; total interest payable increases
despite EMI reduction. Loans restructured once may not qualify for subsequent
restructuring; repeated defaults after restructuring lead directly to legal
action without further concessions. Penal interest charges ranging from 2-5% per
month apply on overdue amounts from default date until recovery, significantly
increasing repayment obligations discouraging delays. Legal costs including
court fees, lawyer charges, and asset liquidation expenses are recovered from
borrowers in addition to principal and interest increasing total liability.
Credit bureau reporting of defaults remains for 7 years impacting future
creditworthiness; loan closure doesn't erase past default history from credit
reports. Recovery actions including asset attachment may cause significant
personal disruption, reputational damage, and emotional stress; borrowers should
prioritize avoiding defaults through proactive financial management. The Bank's
exercise of legal rights doesn't prevent borrowers from challenging actions
through consumer courts, banking mohtasib, or other legal forums as per
applicable laws.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan prudential regulations on loan
classification and provisioning, debt recovery guidelines, and consumer
protection directives prohibiting unfair recovery practices. Recovery processes
undergo annual internal audits and external reviews verifying compliance with
regulatory guidelines, ethical standards, and respect for customer dignity. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory updates, judicial
precedents on recovery practices, and stakeholder feedback including consumer
advocacy groups. Recovery efficiency metrics including collection rates,
resolution timelines, legal recovery success rates, and restructuring
performance are monitored monthly with strategy adjustments for
underperformance. Customer complaints regarding recovery practices, harassment
allegations, or restructuring rejections are investigated within 10 business
days with corrective actions and staff counseling where violations occur. Staff
and third-party agencies receive mandatory training on ethical recovery
practices, communication skills, legal boundaries, and empathy toward distressed
customers conducted quarterly. The Bank maintains comprehensive documentation of
recovery actions including call logs, notices, restructuring evaluations, and
legal proceedings for regulatory inspection and defending potential customer
challenges.
Category 7: Termination and Account Closure Policies
7.1 Voluntary Account Closure Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes transparent procedures for customers to voluntarily
close their accounts, ensuring smooth exit processes while settling all
obligations and protecting customer interests. It aims to provide hassle-free
account closure experiences while maintaining proper documentation and
regulatory compliance. The policy respects customer choice while capturing
feedback for service improvement.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all voluntary account closures initiated by customers
including savings accounts, current accounts, fixed deposits, loan accounts, and
credit card terminations at Amanah Bank. It covers closure request procedures,
documentation requirementsRetrySMContinue2. Scope (continued)
It covers closure request procedures, documentation requirements, settlement of
balances, return of unused cheque books and cards, timeline for closure
completion, and final statement issuance. The policy governs individual
accounts, joint accounts, minor accounts, and corporate accounts across all
channels including branch visits, digital closure requests, and telephone
banking closures. It excludes involuntary closures initiated by the Bank which
are governed by separate termination policies.
3. Definitions
Voluntary Closure: Account closure initiated by customer based on personal
decision. Closure Request: Formal application submitted by customer requesting
account termination. Settlement: Process of clearing all pending transactions,
charges, and obligations before closure. Cooling Period: Waiting period between
closure request and actual closure allowing pending transactions to settle.
Final Statement: Last account statement issued showing final balance, closure
date, and all transactions until closure. Credit Balance: Positive account
balance payable to customer upon closure. Debit Balance: Negative account
balance or outstanding obligations payable by customer before closure.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank respects customer autonomy to close accounts at any time without
requiring justification, ensuring exit processes are convenient, transparent,
and completed within reasonable timeframes. Customers can initiate closure
requests through branches by submitting written applications, or through
internet/mobile banking for accounts without pending obligations or linked
services. Account closure requires settlement of all obligations including
outstanding cheques, pending bill payments, loan EMIs, credit card dues, and any
fees or charges applicable. Credit balances are disbursed to customers through
cheque, transfer to another bank account, or cash (for amounts below PKR 50,000)
as per customer preference. For accounts with credit balances exceeding PKR
10,000, identity verification through original CNIC and additional
authentication questions ensure funds reach rightful owners preventing fraud.
Cooling period of 7-10 business days applies between closure request and actual
closure allowing pending transactions, standing instructions, and automated
payments to clear preventing incomplete transactions. Fixed deposits closed
before maturity require premature withdrawal processing with applicable
penalties before account closure; alternatively, customers may wait until
maturity for closure. Joint accounts require consent and signatures from all
account holders as per operating instructions; single holder cannot unilaterally
close joint accounts unless "either or survivor" mode permits. Minor accounts
upon minor attaining majority age require closure of minor account and opening
of regular adult account; guardian authorization terminates automatically upon
minor turning 18 years. Unused cheque books, ATM cards, debit cards, and any
other Bank property must be surrendered at closure cut into halves to prevent
post-closure fraudulent usage. Closure confirmation with account closure
certificate is issued immediately upon completion serving as proof for tax
purposes, employer records, or future banking relationships. The Bank retains
closed account records for 10 years as per regulatory requirements supporting
potential tax audits, legal disputes, or customer queries regarding historical
transactions.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must submit formal closure requests in writing at branches or through
authenticated digital channels with clear instructions regarding balance
disposal. All outstanding obligations including loan EMIs, credit card dues,
overdraft balances, and pending cheque payments must be cleared before closure;
customers should verify no pending transactions exist. Customers should
discontinue standing instructions, auto-debit mandates, direct deposits, and
other automated transactions linked to accounts at least 15 days before closure
requests to prevent transaction failures. Unused cheque books must be returned
with all unused leaves intact; missing cheque leaves require stop payment
instructions on those cheques before closure processing. ATM cards and debit
cards must be physically surrendered cut in half across magnetic strip and chip
ensuring they cannot be misused post-closure. For joint accounts, all holders
must provide written consent with signatures; any holder objecting to closure
can prevent closure requiring resolution among holders first. Customers should
provide alternate account details for balance transfer or choose other
disbursement methods clearly; ambiguous instructions delay closure processing.
Fixed deposit premature withdrawal decisions should be made carefully
considering penalty charges; customers may opt to transfer FDs to other banks
instead of premature closure. Tax clearance certificates or no-objection
certificates may be required for certain account types particularly NRI accounts
or corporate accounts before closure approval.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall process closure requests within 10 business days from receipt
of complete documentation and settlement of all obligations ensuring timely
completion. The Bank will verify customer identity thoroughly during closure
requests through original CNIC, signature verification, and additional
authentication to prevent unauthorized closures. Complete account review is
conducted identifying all pending transactions, standing instructions, linked
services, automated payments, and active cheques before closure confirmation.
Customers are informed of any pending obligations, active services, or
complications preventing immediate closure with clear guidance on resolution
steps. Credit balances are disbursed securely through customer's chosen method
within 3 business days of closure approval after all clearances confirm. Final
account statement covering all transactions until closure date including closure
charges (if applicable) is provided immediately upon closure completion. Account
closure confirmation certificates are issued stating account number, closure
date, final balance settlement, and confirmation that no further obligations
exist. The Bank sends closure confirmations to registered email and mobile
numbers preventing fraudulent closures and enabling customers to challenge
unauthorized closure attempts. Closure feedback surveys are conducted
understanding reasons for closure, service deficiencies, and areas for
improvement without pressuring customers to retain accounts. Closed account
records are securely archived for 10 years with controlled access ensuring data
privacy while maintaining regulatory compliance and supporting potential future
queries.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Accounts with active loans, credit cards, or overdraft facilities cannot be
closed until all credit facilities are fully settled; loan foreclosure with
applicable charges must precede account closure. Fixed deposits with balances
exceeding PKR 5,00,000 require additional verification including in-person
branch visits regardless of digital closure request capability. Accounts under
legal attachment, regulatory investigation, or dispute proceedings cannot be
closed until legal clearances are obtained from courts or authorities. Dormant
accounts require reactivation before closure with identity re-verification
ensuring rightful owner initiates closure rather than fraudulent parties. The
cooling period may extend beyond 10 days if pending cheques, international
transactions, or complex standing instructions require extended clearing
periods. Closure charges may apply for accounts closed within 6 months of
opening (typically PKR 500) recovering account setup costs; waiver applies for
senior citizens and financial hardship cases. Joint account closures with
disputes among holders cannot proceed until legal resolution or unanimous
agreement is achieved; the Bank doesn't adjudicate holder disputes. Customers
closing accounts due to dissatisfaction are encouraged to escalate concerns to
customer service management; however, closure requests are honored regardless of
resolution outcomes respecting customer autonomy.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan regulations on account closure,
banker-customer relationship termination principles, and consumer protection
guidelines ensuring fair exit processes. Account closure processes undergo
annual audits verifying identity verification adequacy, settlement completeness,
and timeline compliance. The policy is reviewed annually incorporating customer
feedback on closure experiences, regulatory updates, and operational efficiency
improvements. Closure metrics including turnaround times, customer satisfaction
scores, and reasons for closure are analyzed monthly providing insights for
retention strategies and service improvements. Customer complaints regarding
closure delays, balance settlement disputes, or procedural difficulties are
investigated within 5 business days with expedited resolution. Staff training on
closure procedures, customer communication during exits, feedback collection,
and retention conversation techniques is conducted semi-annually. The Bank
maintains comprehensive closure records including applications, settlement
confirmations, balance disposal records, and closure certificates for regulatory
inspection and audit trails.
7.2 Involuntary Account Termination Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes justifiable grounds and procedures for Bank-initiated
account closures protecting institutional interests while ensuring fair
treatment and due process for customers. It balances Bank's risk management
obligations with customer rights to banking services. The policy aims to
terminate problematic relationships while minimizing disputes and regulatory
concerns.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all forced account closures initiated by Amanah Bank due
to regulatory violations, fraudulent activities, persistent misuse, AML/CFT
concerns, legal requirements, or unacceptable customer conduct. It covers
decision-making authority, notification requirements, appeal procedures,
settlement processes, and timelines for involuntary closures. The policy governs
closures across all account types including deposit accounts, loan accounts,
credit facilities, and complete customer relationship termination. It applies
universally to individual, joint, corporate, and institutional customers.
3. Definitions
Involuntary Closure: Account termination initiated by Bank due to policy
violations or risk concerns. Material Breach: Serious violation of account terms
justifying immediate closure. Notice Period: Advance warning provided to
customers before closure implementation allowing resolution opportunities. Right
to Hearing: Customer's opportunity to present explanations before final closure
decision. Blacklisting: Internal flagging preventing future account opening or
banking relationship. Regulatory Closure: Account termination mandated by
regulators or law enforcement. Risk-Based Closure: Termination due to
unacceptable money laundering, fraud, or credit risk exposure.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank reserves the right to terminate customer accounts and relationships
when continuation poses unacceptable risks to the Bank, violates regulations, or
breaches customer obligations despite being committed to long-term customer
relationships. Grounds for involuntary closure include submission of false KYC
information or forged documents, involvement in fraudulent transactions or money
laundering activities, persistent cheque dishonor indicating financial
mismanagement, account usage for illegal purposes, threatening or abusive
behavior toward staff, failure to update KYC documents despite repeated
requests, accounts designated by regulatory or law enforcement authorities, and
material breach of account terms and conditions. Closure decisions are made by
designated senior management committees after thorough investigation, evidence
review, and consideration of customer responses ensuring objectivity and
consistency. Customers are provided written notice at least 30 days before
closure (except for fraud or legal cases requiring immediate action) explaining
closure reasons and providing appeal opportunities. During notice period,
account operations continue normally allowing customers to make alternate
arrangements, settle obligations, and transfer funds to other banks minimizing
disruption. Customers may appeal closure decisions within 15 days of notice by
submitting written explanations, supporting documents, and requesting
reconsideration by higher management or Bank's grievance committee. Upon closure
confirmation, all credit facilities are recalled immediately, outstanding
obligations become due, credit balances are disbursed after settling dues, and
account closure certificates are issued. Customers whose accounts are closed for
fraud, money laundering, or regulatory violations are blacklisted from future
account opening at Amanah Bank and reported to credit bureaus and banking
industry databases as appropriate. The Bank maintains confidentiality regarding
closure reasons except when disclosure is legally required to regulators, law
enforcement, or in response to court orders.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers receiving closure notices must immediately review reasons, assess
validity, and respond within the appeal period if grounds exist for
reconsideration. Outstanding obligations including loans, overdrafts, credit
card dues, and any fees must be settled immediately upon closure notice; failure
to settle leads to legal recovery actions. Customers should make alternate
banking arrangements during notice period including opening accounts elsewhere,
redirecting salary deposits, updating standing instructions, and informing
beneficiaries of account changes. If closure reasons involve documentary
deficiencies such as expired KYC documents, customers should promptly submit
updated documents to prevent closure. Customers disputing closure decisions
should provide substantive evidence contradicting Bank's findings rather than
emotional appeals; factual documentation strengthens appeal cases. Issued
cheques outstanding at closure may be dishonored causing payee inconvenience and
legal complications; customers must inform payees and arrange alternate
payments. Customers whose accounts are closed for cause should understand that
negative information may be reported to credit bureaus affecting future
creditworthiness and banking relationships. Legal recourse through Banking
Mohtasib or consumer courts is available if customers believe closures are
unjustified; however, pursuing legal action doesn't prevent closure
implementation during proceedings.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall investigate thoroughly before closure decisions collecting
evidence, reviewing transaction histories, obtaining staff inputs, and
documenting findings comprehensively. Closure notices are sent through
registered mail, email, and courier to all registered addresses ensuring
customers receive notifications and have opportunities to respond. The notice
clearly states specific closure reasons with sufficient detail enabling
customers to understand violations and prepare responses if appealing. During
notice period, the Bank remains open to customer explanations, documentary
evidence, or remediation proposals that may reverse closure decisions. Appeals
are reviewed by independent senior management not involved in initial closure
decisions ensuring objective reconsideration without bias. Customers are
informed of appeal outcomes within 15 business days with detailed explanations
of final decisions and any conditions for decision reversal. Upon closure,
complete account settlement is conducted calculating final obligations,
adjusting for pending transactions, and determining net payable or receivable
amounts. Credit balances are disbursed within 7 business days through customer's
designated method after deducting any dues ensuring customers receive rightful
funds. Closure confirmation certificates are issued documenting closure date,
final settlement, and confirmation of no further obligations providing closure
proof for customer records. The Bank maintains comprehensive closure files
including investigation reports, notices, customer responses, appeal reviews,
and final decisions for audit, regulatory inspection, and potential legal
challenges.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Immediate closures without notice periods apply for fraud, money laundering,
terrorist financing, or when regulators mandate urgent action protecting
financial system integrity. Closure decisions are final after appeal processes;
however, customers may seek external recourse through Banking Mohtasib or
consumer forums as independent remedies. Accounts with active loans or credit
facilities face accelerated repayment demands; entire outstanding balances
become immediately due upon closure notification. Joint accounts face closure
based on primary holder's violations; co-holders may open separate individual
accounts if not implicated in violations. Blacklisting for closure cause
prevents account opening across all Amanah Bank branches for a minimum period of
3 years; longer periods apply for serious violations like fraud. The Bank is not
obligated to disclose specific evidence or internal investigation details if
disclosure compromises security, other investigations, or regulatory
confidentiality. Customers may experience difficulties opening accounts
elsewhere due to closure reasons visible in banking industry databases; this
consequence is inherent to relationship termination for cause. Legal costs
incurred by the Bank in closure-related disputes including staff time, legal
fees, and recovery expenses may be charged to customers if legally permissible.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan guidelines on account closure,
AML/CFT reporting obligations, consumer protection regulations ensuring due
process, and banking company ordinance provisions. Involuntary closure decisions
undergo quarterly internal audits verifying procedural compliance, notice
adequacy, appeal consideration, and documentation completeness. The policy is
reviewed annually ensuring consistency with regulatory expectations, legal
precedents from Banking Mohtasib decisions, and fairness standards. Closure
statistics including grounds distribution, appeal success rates, and Mohtasib
complaints are monitored quarterly identifying any patterns suggesting
procedural improvements needed. Customer complaints regarding involuntary
closures escalated to Mohtasib or regulatory authorities are analyzed for
adverse decisions indicating policy or process deficiencies. Staff training on
involuntary closure procedures, evidence documentation, customer communication,
and appeal evaluation is conducted annually emphasizing fairness and due
process. The Bank maintains indefinite records of involuntary closures including
complete investigation files supporting decisions if challenged legally years
after closure.
B. Regulatory and Compliance Policies
Category 8: Consumer Protection and Rights Policies
8.1 Customer Rights and Fair Treatment Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes Amanah Bank's commitment to treating all customers
fairly, transparently, and respectfully while protecting their fundamental
rights as banking service consumers. It ensures equitable treatment regardless
of socio-economic status, background, or transaction size. The policy aims to
build trust through ethical conduct, transparency, and accountability in all
customer interactions.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customer interactions across all products, services,
channels, and touchpoints at Amanah Bank including account management, lending,
payments, customer service, complaint handling, and product sales. It covers
rights to information, privacy, fair treatment, complaint redressal, grievance
escalation, and protection from unfair practices. The policy governs employee
conduct, marketing practices, product design, fee structures, and service
delivery ensuring customer-centricity. It applies to all customers including
individuals, small businesses, corporate clients, and prospective customers.
3. Definitions
Customer Rights: Fundamental entitlements of banking customers to fair
treatment, transparency, privacy, and recourse. Fair Treatment: Equitable
service delivery without discrimination based on account balance, relationship
value, or personal characteristics. Transparency: Clear, accurate, and timely
disclosure of terms, conditions, fees, and rights. Vulnerable Customer:
Individuals requiring special consideration including seniors, disabled persons,
financially unsophisticated, or distressed borrowers. Complaint: Customer
expression of dissatisfaction regarding products, services, or staff conduct
requiring resolution. Grievance: Unresolved complaint requiring escalation to
higher management or external authorities.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank commits to treating all customers with respect, dignity, and
fairness regardless of account balance, transaction size, or relationship
duration ensuring inclusive banking experiences. Customers have the right to
clear, accurate information about products including features, fees, terms,
conditions, and risks in simple language avoiding complex jargon or fine print
deception. All terms and conditions are disclosed upfront before account opening
or product purchase; hidden charges, surprise fees, or undisclosed terms are
strictly prohibited. Customers have the right to choose products suitable for
their needs without coercion, mis-selling, or incentive-driven product pushing
by staff; suitability assessments precede product recommendations. Fair pricing
applies universally; customers with similar profiles receive comparable pricing
without arbitrary discrimination, though risk-based differentiation is permitted
with clear rationale. Customers have the right to privacy and confidentiality;
personal information is protected and shared only with consent or legal
obligation without unauthorized disclosure or commercial exploitation. Complaint
mechanisms are accessible through multiple channels including branches,
helpline, email, and online platforms with acknowledgment within 24 hours and
resolution commitments within specified timelines. Customers dissatisfied with
complaint resolution have the right to escalate to senior management, internal
ombudsman, Banking Mohtasib, or consumer courts without fear of retaliation or
service deterioration. Vulnerable customers including seniors, disabled persons,
non-literate customers, and financially distressed borrowers receive special
consideration with patient service, simplified processes, and protection from
exploitation. Customers have the right to exit banking relationships voluntarily
without unreasonable restrictions, penalties, or obstacles honoring their
autonomy to switch banks based on service satisfaction.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate, complete information during account opening,
loan applications, and service requests enabling appropriate product
recommendations and risk assessment. Customers should read and understand terms
and conditions before signing agreements; seeking clarifications on unclear
terms is encouraged rather than signing without comprehension. Banking products
should be used for intended legitimate purposes; misuse for illegal activities,
fraud, or policy violations enables Bank intervention including relationship
termination. Customers should maintain confidentiality of banking credentials
including passwords, PINs, OTPs, and account information preventing unauthorized
access by third parties. Complaints should be raised through proper channels
with factual information and supporting evidence rather than vague accusations
or emotional outbursts facilitating objective investigation. Customers should
respond to Bank communications regarding KYC updates, policy changes, or account
irregularities within reasonable timeframes enabling compliance and issue
resolution. Respectful, courteous interaction with Bank staff is expected;
abusive behavior, threats, or violence toward employees is unacceptable and may
result in relationship termination. Customers should honor financial commitments
including loan repayments, maintaining minimum balances, and adhering to account
terms; persistent violations affect relationship continuity and
creditworthiness.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall design products and services with customer interests as
primary consideration avoiding features intended to confuse, trap, or exploit
customers for short-term profits. All marketing materials, product brochures,
and advertisements are truthful, not misleading, and highlight risks alongside
benefits ensuring informed customer decisions. Staff are trained to prioritize
customer suitability over sales targets; mis-selling to achieve targets is
prohibited with disciplinary consequences for violations. Fees and charges are
displayed prominently on websites, branches, and mobile apps with advance notice
before any changes enabling customers to make informed choices. Customer data is
protected through robust cybersecurity measures, access controls, and staff
training on privacy regulations preventing breaches and unauthorized
disclosures. Complaints are handled professionally and objectively without
dismissiveness or defensiveness; every complaint is investigated fairly with
outcomes communicated transparently. The Bank maintains an internal ombudsman
function for escalated grievances providing independent review and fair
adjudication of customer-Bank disputes. Vulnerable customers receive dedicated
support including priority service lanes, audio-visual aids for disabled
customers, and financial counseling for distressed borrowers demonstrating
social responsibility. Staff conduct is monitored through mystery shopping,
customer feedback, and service audits; employees violating fair treatment
principles face counseling, training, or disciplinary action. Customer feedback
through surveys, focus groups, and complaint analysis informs continuous
improvements in products, processes, and service delivery creating a customer-
centric culture.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Fair treatment doesn't preclude risk-based differentiation in pricing, terms, or
service levels based on objective credit risk, relationship value, or regulatory
risk categorization with transparent rationale. Customers engaged in fraudulent
activities, money laundering, or serious policy violations forfeit certain
rights including continued relationship and may face legal action beyond normal
customer treatment principles. The Bank's obligation to protect confidentiality
yields to legal requirements including court orders, regulatory demands, tax
authority requests, and AML/CFT reporting obligations. Complaint resolution
timelines are best-effort commitments; complex cases involving multiple parties,
external investigations, or legal issues may extend beyond standard timelines.
Customer expectations of specific outcomes from complaints may not materialize;
complaints are resolved based on evidence, policies, and fairness rather than
customer demands. Vulnerable customer protections require self-identification or
obvious indicators; the Bank cannot identify all vulnerable situations requiring
customers to communicate special needs proactively. Banking Mohtasib or consumer
court decisions may occasionally override Bank's internal decisions; the Bank
complies with legal directives while reserving rights to appeal when
appropriate. Customer rights to information, privacy, and fair treatment coexist
with Bank's rights to protect interests, manage risks, and terminate
relationships when continuation is untenable.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan Consumer Protection Department
regulations, fair treatment principles in financial services, and international
best practices in customer rights. Customer treatment practices undergo annual
audits by compliance teams evaluating adherence to fair treatment commitments
across all customer touchpoints. The policy is reviewed annually incorporating
customer feedback, regulatory updates, Mohtasib decisions, and emerging consumer
protection standards. Complaint data including volumes, categories, root causes,
and resolution timelines are analyzed monthly identifying systemic issues
requiring process or policy corrections. Mystery shopping exercises are
conducted quarterly assessing staff adherence to fair treatment principles,
transparency in information provision, and product suitability assessments.
Customer satisfaction surveys are conducted semi-annually measuring perceptions
of fairness, transparency, and service quality with results informing
improvement initiatives. Staff training on customer rights, fair treatment,
ethical conduct, and complaint handling is mandatory annually with competency
assessments and refreshers for customer-facing employees. The Bank publishes
annual consumer protection reports transparently disclosing complaint
statistics, resolution rates, and improvement initiatives demonstrating
accountability to customers and regulators.
8.2 Complaint and Grievance Redressal Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive, accessible, and time-bound procedures for
customers to raise complaints and seek redressal ensuring responsive handling
and fair resolution. It aims to convert customer dissatisfaction into
opportunities for service improvement while demonstrating accountability. The
policy provides clear escalation paths including external forums when internal
resolution fails.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customer complaints regarding products, services,
transactions, fees, staff conduct, digital banking, loan processing, account
management, or any aspect of banking relationship with Amanah Bank. It covers
complaint registration channels, acknowledgment procedures, investigation
processes, resolution timelines, escalation mechanisms, and closure protocols.
The policy governs complaints from individual customers, joint account holders,
corporate clients, and third parties authorized by customers. It extends to
complaints raised directly with the Bank and those received through Banking
Mohtasib, regulatory authorities, or social media platforms.
3. Definitions
Complaint: Customer expression of dissatisfaction with Amanah Bank's products,
services, or staff requiring investigation and response. Grievance: Complaint
unresolved at initial level requiring escalation to higher management for review
and decision. Resolution: Bank's response addressing the complaint with
explanation, corrective action, or compensation as appropriate. Turnaround Time
(TAT): Maximum duration within which complaints at each level must be resolved.
Escalation: Process of elevating unresolved complaints to higher authorities for
reconsideration and final decision. Ombudsman: Independent internal authority
reviewing escalated grievances providing impartial adjudication. Banking
Mohtasib: External regulatory authority providing free dispute resolution
between customers and banks.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank welcomes customer complaints as valuable feedback for service
improvement and commits to prompt, fair resolution through transparent
processes. Customers can register complaints through multiple convenient
channels including toll-free helpline (24/7), email addresses dedicated for
complaints, complaint forms at all branches, internet banking complaint portals,
mobile app complaint features, written letters to branch managers or head
office, and social media platforms monitored by customer service teams. Every
complaint receives unique reference numbers upon registration enabling tracking
and follow-up throughout the resolution process. Complaints are acknowledged
within 24 hours through SMS, email, or phone confirming receipt and providing
reference number and expected resolution timeline. First-level complaints are
resolved within 5 business days for simple matters and 15 business days for
complex issues requiring detailed investigation. Customers receive regular
status updates at least every 5 days during complaint investigation preventing
perception of neglect or indifference. Resolution communications explain
findings, decisions, actions taken, and rationale in clear language enabling
customer understanding of outcomes. If customers are dissatisfied with first-
level resolution, they can escalate to branch managers, regional managers, head
office complaint cell, or internal ombudsman with each level providing fresh
review. Final internal escalation to internal ombudsman must conclude within 30
days of initial complaint registration providing definitive Bank position.
Customers unsatisfied with internal resolution can approach Banking Mohtasib
(free dispute resolution) or consumer courts (legal recourse) with the Bank
fully cooperating in external proceedings. Compensation is provided when Bank
errors cause customer losses including interest on delayed payments, penalty
reversals, and reasonable consequential damages within defined limits. No
retaliation, service deterioration, or relationship strain occurs due to
complaint filing; customers are encouraged to raise concerns without fear of
negative consequences.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers should provide complete, accurate information when registering
complaints including account details, transaction references, dates, amounts,
and specific grievances enabling efficient investigation. Supporting documents
such as transaction receipts, email correspondence, SMS records, or photographs
strengthen complaint credibility and facilitate resolution. Complaints should be
raised within reasonable timeframes from the incident occurrence; delayed
complaints make investigation difficult and may affect resolution possibilities.
Customers must preserve complaint reference numbers and respond to Bank queries
during investigation providing additional information or clarifications when
requested. Exaggerated claims, false information, or frivolous complaints waste
resources and undermine genuine grievances; customers should raise legitimate
concerns honestly. While expressing dissatisfaction, customers should maintain
civility and respect; abusive language, threats, or harassment of staff hinder
constructive resolution. Customers should allow reasonable investigation time
before escalating; premature escalations without allowing first-level resolution
disrupt efficient complaint handling. Upon satisfactory resolution, customers
should confirm closure enabling the Bank to officially close complaints and
focus resources on pending issues.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain easily accessible complaint channels with prominent
display of contact information on websites, mobile apps, branches, and ATMs.
Complaint registration systems capture complete information, assign unique
references, and route complaints to appropriate departments based on nature and
complexity. Acknowledgments are sent immediately (within 24 hours) through
customer's preferred channel confirming receipt, providing reference number,
designating responsible officer, and communicating expected resolution timeline.
Investigations are conducted objectively reviewing transaction logs, staff
inputs, system records, and customer evidence to establish facts before
conclusions. Customers are updated regularly during investigation at minimum 5-
day intervals through SMS, email, or phone calls preventing anxiety and
demonstrating active handling. Resolution communications are clear,
comprehensive, and empathetic explaining findings, decisions, and actions taken;
when complaints are rejected, rationale is explained respectfully with evidence.
Where Bank errors are established, corrective actions are implemented
immediately including transaction reversals, fee refunds, interest compensation,
and systemic fixes preventing recurrence. Escalated complaints receive senior
management attention with fresh perspectives ensuring previous level conclusions
are challenged if evidence supports customer claims. Root cause analysis is
conducted on complaint patterns identifying systemic issues, process gaps, or
training needs requiring organizational interventions beyond individual
resolutions. Complaint data including volumes, categories, resolution rates, and
customer satisfaction scores are published in annual reports demonstrating
transparency and accountability.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Resolution timelines are best-effort commitments; highly complex complaints
involving legal interpretations, external parties, or detailed investigations
may exceed standard timelines with explanations provided. Complaints beyond
Bank's control including inter-bank transaction delays, payment network issues,
or third-party merchant problems have limited resolution options with best-
effort facilitation. Compensation for Bank errors is limited to direct financial
losses and reasonable consequential damages; indirect losses, emotional
distress, or reputational damages typically aren't compensated unless legally
mandated. Complaints raising allegations against specific employees are
investigated confidentially; complainants may not receive details of internal
disciplinary actions taken due to employee privacy considerations. Vexatious
complaints filed repeatedly despite satisfactory resolutions, or complaints with
malicious intent to harass staff, may be declined with limited investigation.
Social media complaints receive public acknowledgment directing customers to
private channels for detailed resolution; sensitive information isn't discussed
publicly protecting privacy. Banking Mohtasib can adjudicate complaints up to
PKR 1 million; higher value disputes require consumer court or civil litigation
for resolution. Mohtasib decisions are binding on the Bank; compliance occurs
within mandated timelines even if the Bank disagrees with decisions, though
appeal rights exist in specific circumstances.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan complaint management
guidelines, Consumer Protection Department directives, Banking Mohtasib
jurisdiction and procedures, and service quality standards. Complaint handling
processes undergo quarterly audits assessing acknowledgment timeliness,
investigation quality, resolution adequacy, and compliance with turnaround time
commitments. The policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory updates,
Mohtasib decisions, best practices, and customer feedback on complaint
experiences. Complaint analytics including trending issues, resolution rates,
escalation patterns, and customer satisfaction scores are presented monthly to
senior management driving accountability and improvement. Mystery shopping
evaluations assess complaint handling quality across channels testing staff
responsiveness, empathy, and resolution effectiveness with findings feeding into
training programs. Staff training on complaint handling, active listening,
empathy, investigation techniques, and resolution communication is mandatory
annually for all customer-facing employees. The Bank benchmarks complaint
metrics against peer banks and international standards continuously raising
service quality expectations and complaint handling excellence. Technology
investments in complaint management systems, AI-driven categorization, and
customer feedback tools are prioritized enhancing efficiency and customer
experience.
Category 9: Transparency and Ethical Conduct Policies
9.1 Fee and Charge Transparency Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive transparency in all fees, charges, and
costs associated with banking products ensuring customers make informed
financial decisions. It prevents hidden charges, surprise fees, and exploitative
pricing practices. The policy aims to build trust through clear, upfront
disclosure of all costs enabling customers to compare options and manage banking
expenses effectively.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all fees and charges levied by Amanah Bank including
account maintenance fees, transaction charges, ATM fees, loan processing fees,
prepayment charges, penalty fees, service charges, and any other costs customers
may incur. It covers disclosure requirements in marketing materials, product
brochures, account opening documents, fee schedules, mobile apps, internet
banking, and customer communications. The policy governs fee structure design,
pricing methodologies, change notification procedures, and waiver eligibility.
It applies to all products including deposits, loans, payments, cards, and
digital banking services.
3. Definitions
Fee: Charge levied by the Bank for providing specific services or facilities.
Service Charge: Periodic fee for account maintenance or facility availability
regardless of usage. Transaction Charge: Fee levied per transaction such as ATM
withdrawals, fund transfers, or cheque issuance. Penalty Fee: Charge imposed for
policy violations such as minimum balance non-maintenance, cheque dishonor, or
late loan payments. Processing Fee: One-time charge for processing applications
such as loan origination or account opening. Hidden Charge: Fee not disclosed
upfront or buried in fine print constituting unfair practice. Fee Schedule:
Comprehensive document listing all applicable fees with amounts and conditions
clearly specified.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank commits to complete transparency in all fees and charges with
upfront disclosure before customers commit to products or services eliminating
surprises or hidden costs. A comprehensive fee schedule listing all charges
across all products is published prominently on the Bank's website, mobile app,
displayed at all branches, and provided in account opening kits ensuring easy
accessibility. Fee schedules are written in simple language avoiding jargon,
with clear descriptions of what each fee covers, when it applies, calculation
methods, and any conditions or waivers available. At account opening or loan
processing, customers receive personalized fee disclosures highlighting fees
applicable to their specific products, anticipated transaction patterns, and
estimated annual banking costs. Marketing materials and product advertisements
disclose material fees prominently; attractive headline rates or features are
not promoted without accompanying cost disclosures preventing misleading
advertising. New fees or fee increases are communicated at least 30 days in
advance through multiple channels including SMS, email, branch notices, website
updates, and account statements allowing customers to adjust usage or close
accounts if dissatisfied. Customers opting out within the notice period for fee
increases are not charged increased fees and can close accounts without closure
penalties respecting their right to reject new terms. Fee waivers are available
for specific customer segments including senior citizens, persons with
disabilities, students, low-balance accounts, and salary account holders as part
of financial inclusion commitments clearly disclosed in fee schedules. Penalty
fees are reasonable and proportionate to the violation or cost incurred by the
Bank; excessive or punitive fees designed purely for revenue generation are
prohibited. Digital channels including internet banking and mobile apps display
applicable fees before transaction confirmation enabling customers to cancel if
unwilling to pay charges.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must review fee schedules before opening accounts or availing services
understanding cost implications and assessing affordability and value
proposition. During account opening, customers should ask staff to explain
applicable fees, typical charges based on anticipated usage, and any fee waivers
they may qualify for ensuring clear comprehension. Fee disclosures provided in
account opening kits or loan agreements should be read carefully; signing
constitutes acknowledgment of fees making subsequent disputes difficult.
Customers should monitor account statements regularly identifying fee debits,
verifying accuracy, and raising disputes promptly if unexplained or incorrect
charges appear. Maintaining minimum balances, avoiding excessive transactions,
or meeting fee waiver criteria are customer responsibilities to minimize banking
costs through prudent account management. Customers dissatisfied with fee
changes communicated in advance should exercise opt-out rights including account
closure rather than continuing relationship and subsequently complaining. When
comparing banking products across institutions, customers should consider total
cost including all fees rather than focusing solely on interest rates or
headline features for informed decisions. Customers seeking fee waivers should
provide supporting documentation proving eligibility such as student IDs, senior
citizen status, or disability certificates enabling Bank verification.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain comprehensive, up-to-date fee schedules covering all
products and services with regular reviews ensuring accuracy and completeness.
Fee schedules are accessible through multiple channels with consistent
information across website, mobile app, branches, and customer service ensuring
customers receive uniform information regardless of inquiry method. Product
design incorporates cost considerations with fees set to recover reasonable
costs and provide fair profit margins without exploiting customers particularly
vulnerable segments. Before implementing new fees or increasing existing fees,
impact assessments are conducted evaluating customer segments affected,
potential hardships, alternatives available, and justification ensuring
fairness. Fee change notifications are clear, prominent, and timely (minimum 30
days advance) through multiple channels with opt-out instructions and customer
service contactsRetrySMContinue6. Bank Responsibilities (continued)
Fee change notifications are clear, prominent, and timely (minimum 30 days
advance) through multiple channels with opt-out instructions and customer
service contacts for queries ensuring customers can make informed decisions.
Staff across all branches and customer service channels are trained on fee
structures, waiver eligibility, and transparent communication enabling
consistent, accurate fee information provision to customers. Fee disputes raised
by customers are investigated promptly reviewing transaction details, fee
applicability, and any errors with reversals and compensation for incorrect
charges within 5 business days. The Bank conducts periodic benchmarking of fees
against peer banks and international standards ensuring competitiveness,
reasonableness, and alignment with market practices. Fee revenue and cost
recovery metrics are monitored ensuring fees serve legitimate business purposes
rather than exploitative profit maximization at customer expense. Annual
disclosures in reports and websites provide transparency on fee income as
percentage of total revenue demonstrating balance between fee revenue and
customer-friendly pricing. Customer feedback on fee structures through surveys,
complaints, and branch interactions is analyzed systematically identifying
unpopular fees or areas requiring simplification.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Third-party charges such as payment network fees, correspondent bank charges, or
regulatory levies are passed through to customers with clear disclosure that
these are external costs not controlled by Amanah Bank. Cross-border
transactions attract additional fees including foreign exchange margins, SWIFT
charges, and intermediary bank costs which vary based on transaction specifics
making exact pre-disclosure challenging; estimated ranges are provided. Penalty
fees for violations such as cheque dishonor or minimum balance non-maintenance
are punitive by design deterring negative behaviors; however, reasonableness
standards and regulatory caps are adhered to. Fee waivers for specific segments
may require annual re-verification of eligibility; customers maintaining waiver
eligibility must provide updated documentation periodically or lose waivers.
Negotiated fees for high-value corporate clients, jumbo deposits, or special
arrangements may differ from published schedules reflecting relationship pricing
and volume considerations with proper documentation. Promotional zero-fee
periods or special offers have defined validity clearly communicated in
promotional materials; reverting to standard fees occurs automatically post-
promotion without individual notifications. Regulatory changes mandating fee
increases or new charges are implemented with minimal advance notice citing
regulatory compliance requirements beyond Bank control. Fee structures may
change based on cost inflation, regulatory requirements, or business
sustainability needs; the Bank retains pricing autonomy with transparency
commitments but not rate freezes.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan transparency requirements,
Consumer Protection Department fee disclosure guidelines, and international
principles of fair pricing in financial services. Fee schedules and disclosure
practices undergo semi-annual compliance audits verifying accuracy,
accessibility, and adherence to advance notification requirements for changes.
The policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory updates, customer
feedback on fee transparency, and best practices in fee communication. Fee-
related complaints including allegations of hidden charges, incorrect debits, or
inadequate disclosure are tracked and analyzed monthly identifying systemic
disclosure gaps. Mystery shopping exercises assess fee disclosure quality at
branches and through customer service channels testing staff knowledge,
transparency, and provision of complete information. Customer surveys on fee
transparency and satisfaction with fee levels are conducted annually with
results informing fee structure reviews and communication improvements. Staff
training on fee structures, transparent communication, handling fee objections,
and waiver processing is conducted quarterly ensuring consistent customer
experience. Technology investments in dynamic fee disclosure tools, transaction-
time fee alerts, and personalized fee calculators are prioritized enhancing
customer understanding and control over banking costs.
9.2 Conflict of Interest Management Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes frameworks for identifying, disclosing, and managing
conflicts of interest to ensure customer interests take precedence over
institutional or employee interests. It protects customers from biased advice,
unfair treatment, or exploitation arising from conflicting interests. The policy
aims to maintain integrity, trust, and ethical conduct in all customer
interactions and business decisions.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all situations where Amanah Bank's interests, employee
interests, or third-party interests may conflict with customer interests
including product recommendations, loan decisions, investment advice, and
service delivery. It covers conflicts arising from incentive structures, related
party transactions, employee personal investments, vendor relationships, and
cross-selling activities. The policy governs disclosure requirements, mitigation
measures, decision-making protocols, and oversight mechanisms. It applies to all
employees, directors, agents, and third parties acting on behalf of the Bank in
customer interactions.
3. Definitions
Conflict of Interest: Situation where personal, institutional, or third-party
interests may compromise objective decision-making in customer's best interest.
Material Conflict: Significant conflict substantially affecting recommendations,
decisions, or treatment of customers. Related Party: Individual or entity having
special relationship with the Bank or its employees creating potential
conflicts. Chinese Wall: Information barrier between departments preventing
conflicts from sharing of confidential information. Disclosure: Transparent
communication to customers about conflicts enabling informed decisions. Recusal:
Voluntary withdrawal from decision-making when conflicts compromise objectivity.
Independent Review: Evaluation by parties without conflicts ensuring fairness.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank prioritizes customer interests above institutional profit
maximization or employee incentives when conflicts arise, maintaining fiduciary
responsibility and ethical conduct. Employees are required to identify and
disclose conflicts of interest immediately upon awareness to supervisors and
compliance officers enabling appropriate management before customer harm.
Product recommendations to customers are based on suitability assessments
considering customer needs, risk profiles, and financial situations rather than
employee incentive structures or Bank revenue goals. Sales incentives and
performance targets are structured to reward customer satisfaction, appropriate
product matching, and long-term relationship value rather than short-term
transaction volumes or high-margin product pushing. Employees advising customers
on investments, insurance, or financial products disclose compensation
arrangements including commissions, fees, or incentives received for specific
product sales enabling customer evaluation of advice objectivity. Related party
lending, transactions with directors or employees, or dealings with entities
having ownership links to Bank personnel undergo enhanced scrutiny, independent
approval, and disclosure preventing favoritism or conflicts. Chinese Walls
separate departments handling proprietary trading, investment banking, or
confidential client information from retail banking operations preventing
information misuse. Employees trading in securities of companies where the Bank
has material non-public information or where employee involvement in Bank
decisions creates conflicts must pre-clear transactions and face trading
restrictions. Gifts, entertainment, or favors from vendors, borrowers, or
customers beyond minimal value (typically below PKR 5,000) are prohibited
preventing improper influence on decisions or service delivery. Situations where
conflicts cannot be eliminated are transparently disclosed to customers before
transactions, and customers may seek independent advice or choose alternatives
without pressure.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers should inquire about employee compensation structures when receiving
financial advice understanding whether advisors receive commissions influencing
recommendations enabling evaluation of advice objectivity. When offered
products, customers should assess suitability against their needs rather than
relying solely on sales presentations; seeking independent advice or comparing
alternatives ensures informed decisions. Customers should disclose their
complete financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals to enable appropriate
recommendations; incomplete information leads to unsuitable products regardless
of conflict management. If suspecting biased recommendations due to conflicts,
customers should escalate concerns to branch managers or compliance officers for
independent review of advice and alternatives. Customers should read conflict
disclosures provided in product documents understanding implications and
assessing whether disclosed conflicts affect their comfort with proceeding.
Related parties of Bank including employees or directors seeking banking
services should disclose relationships enabling appropriate conflict management
and enhanced scrutiny. Customers approached by Bank employees for personal
investments, business ventures, or unofficial transactions should report such
approaches as serious conflicts warranting investigation. Accepting
inappropriate gifts, favors, or special treatments from Bank staff may create
obligations or expectations; customers should decline such offers maintaining
arm's length relationships.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall establish clear policies defining acceptable and prohibited
conflicts with specific examples, thresholds, and disclosure requirements
communicated to all employees. Incentive structures for sales staff,
relationship managers, and advisors are reviewed annually ensuring alignment
with customer interest priorities over pure revenue generation. Conflicts
identified in customer interactions trigger mandatory disclosure in writing
before product finalization or advice implementation enabling customers to make
informed decisions. Independent review mechanisms including compliance
committees, ethics officers, or senior management oversight evaluate high-
conflict situations ensuring customer interests are protected. Related party
transaction registers are maintained recording all dealings with directors,
employees, or connected entities with enhanced approval requirements and
periodic Board review. Chinese Wall protocols include physical separation,
information access controls, and confidentiality training preventing improper
information flows between conflicted departments. Employee trading policies
require pre-clearance of personal investments in securities, mandatory holding
periods, and restrictions during sensitive periods preventing insider trading or
conflicts. Gifts and entertainment received by employees are declared in
registers with values exceeding thresholds requiring senior management approval
or declining; aggregate tracking prevents circumvention through multiple small
gifts. Vendor relationships are managed through competitive processes, arm's
length terms, and rotation policies preventing dependency or favoritism
compromising objective decision-making. Customer complaints alleging biased
advice, conflict-driven recommendations, or unfair treatment due to conflicts
are investigated by independent parties with remediation for confirmed
violations.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Certain inherent conflicts exist in banking including the Bank's profit motive
potentially conflicting with lowest-cost solutions for customers; these
fundamental conflicts are acknowledged with reliance on regulatory oversight and
competitive markets for discipline. Cross-selling opportunities where existing
customers are approached for additional products involve conflicts between
relationship expansion and avoiding over-commitment; transparent needs
assessment and voluntary customer consent mitigate these conflicts. Group
structures where Amanah Bank has affiliates in insurance, investments, or other
financial services create referral conflicts managed through disclosure,
customer choice, and prohibition of coercive bundling. Employment of relatives
in different Bank departments may create conflicts in credit decisions or
service delivery; comprehensive related party policies including recusal
requirements manage these situations. Small community branches where staff have
personal relationships with customers face inherent conflicts managed through
dual authorization, supervisor oversight, and conflict disclosure rather than
relationship prohibition. Performance pressures during quarter-ends or year-ends
may incentivize aggressive sales potentially conflicting with customer
suitability; monitoring systems detect unusual patterns triggering reviews. The
Bank's role as both lender and deposit-taker creates conflicts in fund
allocation decisions between maximizing lending returns and deposit interest
payments; Asset Liability Committee oversight and regulatory requirements
provide governance. Complete conflict elimination is impractical in banking; the
policy therefore emphasizes identification, disclosure, mitigation, and
oversight rather than absolute conflict prohibition.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan governance guidelines, conflict
of interest management requirements, and ethical standards for financial
institutions. Conflict of interest registers, related party transactions, and
employee trading activities undergo quarterly internal audits verifying
compliance with disclosure and approval requirements. The policy is reviewed
annually incorporating regulatory updates, emerging conflict scenarios from
business evolution, and lessons from conflict-related complaints or violations.
Conflicts of interest statistics including identified conflicts, disclosed
instances, independent reviews conducted, and remediation actions are reported
quarterly to Board Risk and Audit Committees. Employee training on conflict
identification, disclosure obligations, ethical decision-making, and specific
policy provisions is mandatory annually with scenario-based assessments.
Whistleblower mechanisms enable anonymous reporting of undisclosed conflicts,
biased advice, or policy violations without fear of retaliation encouraging
ethical culture. The Bank benchmarks conflict management practices against peer
institutions and international standards continuously enhancing frameworks as
best practices evolve. Independent ethics reviews by external consultants every
three years assess conflict management effectiveness, organizational culture,
and framework adequacy providing improvement recommendations.
Category 10: Data Privacy and Security Policies
10.1 Customer Data Protection and Privacy Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safeguards for customer personal and
financial information protecting privacy, preventing unauthorized access, and
ensuring compliant data handling. It aims to build customer trust through
responsible data stewardship while enabling legitimate business uses. The policy
balances data utility for service delivery with stringent privacy protections
and customer control over information.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customer data collected, processed, stored,
transmitted, or shared by Amanah Bank including personal identification,
financial information, transaction data, communication records, and behavioral
analytics. It covers data across all formats including electronic databases,
paper records, audio recordings, video surveillance, and mobile app data. The
policy governs data collection practices, consent requirements, usage
limitations, security measures, sharing protocols, retention periods, and
customer access rights. It applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and
third parties handling customer data on the Bank's behalf across all locations
and channels.
3. Definitions
Personal Data: Information identifying or relating to an individual customer
including name, CNIC, contact details, financial status, and transaction
history. Sensitive Data: Highly confidential information requiring enhanced
protection including passwords, PINs, biometrics, account balances, and credit
information. Data Processing: Collection, storage, analysis, transmission, or
any handling of customer data. Data Subject: Customer whose personal information
is being processed by the Bank. Consent: Informed, voluntary agreement by
customer for specific data processing activities. Data Breach: Unauthorized
access, disclosure, loss, or compromise of customer data. Anonymization:
Removing personally identifiable elements making data unable to identify
individuals. Right to Erasure: Customer's right to request deletion of personal
data under specified circumstances.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank collects only data necessary for account opening, service delivery,
regulatory compliance, and fraud prevention avoiding excessive or irrelevant
information gathering. At data collection, customers are informed of purposes,
legal basis, retention periods, sharing arrangements, and rights regarding their
information through clear privacy notices. Explicit customer consent is obtained
for data processing beyond core banking services including marketing
communications, product recommendations, and data analytics with easy opt-out
mechanisms. Customer data is used exclusively for stated purposes; repurposing
data for new uses requires fresh consent or legitimate interest assessment with
customer notification. Robust technical and organizational security measures
protect customer data including encryption, access controls, network security,
secure data centers, and regular security audits preventing unauthorized access
or breaches. Access to customer data is restricted on need-to-know basis with
role-based permissions, activity logging, and periodic access reviews ensuring
only authorized personnel access specific data for legitimate purposes. Customer
data is shared with third parties only when necessary for service delivery
(payment processors, credit bureaus) or legally mandated (regulators, law
enforcement) with contractual protections ensuring third-party compliance.
Customers have rights to access their personal data, request corrections of
inaccuracies, obtain data portability in structured formats, object to certain
processing, and request erasure where legally permissible. Data retention
periods align with regulatory requirements typically 10 years for financial
records; data is securely deleted or anonymized after retention periods expire
preventing indefinite storage. Data breaches are investigated immediately upon
detection with incident response protocols including containment, impact
assessment, notification to affected customers and regulators, and remediation
measures.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate personal information during account opening and
promptly update changes enabling the Bank to maintain current records for
service delivery and communication. Login credentials, passwords, PINs, and OTPs
are customer secrets to be safeguarded; sharing with others including family
members compromises data security and may result in customer liability for
unauthorized transactions. Customers should use secure devices and networks for
digital banking avoiding public WiFi or shared devices for financial
transactions preventing data interception or malware risks. Privacy settings in
mobile apps and internet banking should be reviewed and configured according to
customer preferences controlling data sharing, marketing communications, and
behavioral tracking. Customers should report suspected data breaches including
phishing emails, unauthorized account access, or suspicious communications
immediately enabling the Bank to investigate and mitigate impact. Phishing
awareness is customer responsibility; customers should verify communication
authenticity before clicking links, downloading attachments, or providing
information preventing social engineering attacks. Consent for marketing
communications can be withdrawn anytime through opt-out links, customer service
requests, or privacy preference centers; customers should actively manage
communication preferences. Data access requests, correction requests, or erasure
requests should be submitted formally through designated channels with proper
identification enabling the Bank to process requests accurately and securely.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall implement layered security architecture including firewalls,
intrusion detection systems, encryption, secure authentication, and continuous
monitoring protecting customer data from cyber threats. Data encryption applies
to data at rest (stored data) and data in transit (network transmissions) using
industry-standard encryption protocols preventing unauthorized access even if
data is intercepted. Access controls include unique user IDs, strong password
policies, multi-factor authentication for privileged access, and automatic
timeout preventing unauthorized access from unattended terminals. Employee
training on data privacy, security best practices, phishing recognition, and
handling of sensitive information is mandatory quarterly creating a security-
conscious workforce. Vendor contracts include stringent data protection clauses
requiring equivalent security standards, limiting data usage to specified
purposes, and enabling audit rights ensuring third-party compliance. Privacy
impact assessments are conducted for new products, systems, or data processing
activities identifying privacy risks and implementing controls before launch.
Data breach response plans include detection mechanisms, escalation protocols,
forensic investigation capabilities, notification templates, and recovery
procedures enabling rapid, effective response. Customer data access requests are
fulfilled within 15 business days providing data in portable formats; correction
requests are processed within 10 days with verification of requester identity.
Annual privacy audits by internal and external auditors assess compliance with
privacy policies, regulatory requirements, and international standards like ISO
27001 identifying improvement areas. Transparency reports published annually
disclose data request statistics from regulators and law enforcement, breach
incidents, and privacy program enhancements demonstrating accountability.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Regulatory requirements mandate data sharing with State Bank of Pakistan,
Federal Board of Revenue, Financial Monitoring Unit, and other authorities
without individual customer consent as legal obligations. Credit bureaus receive
customer credit information enabling credit risk assessment across the banking
industry; customers cannot opt-out of credit bureau reporting as it serves
system-wide risk management. Court orders, investigation demands, or legal
process may require customer data disclosure; the Bank complies with lawful
demands while challenging overly broad or improper requests protecting customer
interests. Fraud investigation and prevention may involve data sharing with
other banks, law enforcement, or industry databases identifying fraudsters and
protecting the financial system. Data retention for legal compliance purposes
prevents immediate deletion upon customer request; minimum retention periods
must complete before erasure requests are honored. Anonymized, aggregated data
used for analytics, research, or reporting doesn't identify individuals and
isn't subject to individual access or erasure rights as it's no longer personal
data. Cross-border data transfers for international payments, correspondent
banking, or group services may occur with appropriate safeguards including
contractual protections and adequacy assessments. Complete data deletion may not
be technically feasible for backup archives or distributed systems; data is
marked for non-restoration and eventual deletion during backup rotation cycles.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan data protection guidelines,
Electronic Transactions Ordinance, Telegraph Act provisions on communication
privacy, and international standards like GDPR principles. Information security
management systems certified to ISO 27001 standards undergo annual surveillance
audits and triennial recertification audits verifying ongoing compliance. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory changes, technological
advancements in security, emerging threats, and evolving privacy expectations.
Data breach incidents, privacy complaints, and security incidents are analyzed
monthly for patterns identifying systemic vulnerabilities requiring enhanced
controls or policy updates. Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
conducted quarterly by independent security firms identify technical weaknesses
before malicious actors exploit them. Employee compliance with data protection
policies is monitored through access log reviews, privacy training completion
tracking, and disciplinary actions for violations creating accountability.
Customer surveys on privacy perceptions, trust levels, and concerns inform
privacy program enhancements and communication strategies building confidence in
Bank's data stewardship. The Bank maintains cyber insurance coverage protecting
against financial impacts of data breaches while prioritizing prevention as
primary strategy.
10.2 Cybersecurity and Digital Banking Security Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive cybersecurity measures protecting digital
banking channels, customer transactions, and information systems from cyber
threats including hacking, malware, phishing, and fraud. It ensures resilient,
secure technology infrastructure enabling safe digital banking experiences. The
policy aims to prevent cyber incidents while maintaining rapid detection and
response capabilities when threats materialize.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all digital banking channels including internet banking,
mobile banking apps, SMS banking, USSD banking, and API-based integrations used
by Amanah Bank customers. It covers security architecture, authentication
mechanisms, transaction security, malware protection, network security,
application security, and infrastructure resilience. The policy governs customer
security obligations, Bank security responsibilities, incident response
procedures, and recovery mechanisms. It applies to all technology assets
including servers, networks, applications, databases, endpoints, and cloud
services.
3. Definitions
Cybersecurity: Protection of information systems, networks, and data from
digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA): Security requiring two or more verification factors (password + OTP,
biometric + PIN) for access. Phishing: Fraudulent communication impersonating
legitimate entities to steal credentials or financial information. Malware:
Malicious software including viruses, trojans, ransomware, or spyware designed
to damage systems or steal data. Encryption: Converting data into coded form
requiring decryption keys for access protecting confidentiality. Firewall:
Network security system controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on
security rules. Penetration Testing: Simulated cyber attack assessing security
vulnerabilities before real attackers exploit them. Security Incident: Event
compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems
or data.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank implements defense-in-depth security architecture with multiple
layers of protection including network security, application security, data
security, and endpoint protection preventing single point of failure. Multi-
factor authentication is mandatory for digital banking access requiring
something customer knows (password), something customer has (OTP to mobile), and
optionally something customer is (biometric) enhancing security beyond passwords
alone. Transaction authorization for high-value or high-risk transactions
requires additional verification including OTP, biometric authentication, or
secure tokens preventing unauthorized transactions even with compromised
credentials. Session management includes automatic timeout after 5 minutes of
inactivity, single concurrent session restrictions, and session termination upon
logout preventing unauthorized access from unattended devices. Customer login
credentials are never stored in plain text; passwords are hashed using strong
algorithms with salts, PINs are encrypted, and biometric templates are stored in
secure enclaves preventing credential theft usefulness. Transaction monitoring
systems analyze patterns in real-time detecting anomalies including unusual
login locations, rapid fund transfers, or atypical transaction sequences
triggering alerts and temporary holds for verification. Secure communication
protocols including TLS 1.2+ encryption protect data transmitted between
customer devices and Bank servers preventing eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle
attacks on networks. Application security includes secure coding practices,
regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and security patches
protecting against injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and other web
vulnerabilities. Network security employs firewalls, intrusion
detection/prevention systems, DDoS mitigation, and network segmentation
protecting against external attacks and containing breaches if perimeters are
compromised. Malware protection includes antivirus software on Bank systems,
email filtering, web filtering, and endpoint detection and response solutions
preventing malware infiltration and spread. Mobile app security includes code
obfuscation, root/jailbreak detection, certificate pinning, and secure storage
preventing reverse engineering, tampering, or data extraction from compromised
devices. Security incident response protocols include detection mechanisms,
incident classification, escalation procedures, containment strategies,
eradication steps, recovery processes, and post-incident reviews ensuring rapid
effective response minimizing damage.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must create strong, unique passwords for digital banking combining
uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters avoiding dictionary words,
personal information, or reused passwords from other sites. Passwords and PINs
must never be written down, saved in browsers, shared with others, or disclosed
in response to calls/emails claiming to be from the Bank; staff never ask for
complete passwords. Customers should access digital banking only from trusted
devices that they own and control avoiding public computers, shared devices, or
borrowed phones where malware or keyloggers may capture credentials. Secure
internet connections should be used for banking; public WiFi networks are risky
due to potential eavesdropping; VPNs provide additional protection when using
untrusted networks. Mobile banking apps should be downloaded only from official
app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store); apps from unofficial sources may
contain malware or fake versions designed to steal credentials. Device security
including screen locks, biometric authentication, and updated operating systems
with latest security patches protects against unauthorized access if devices are
lost or stolen. Customers should verify website authenticity before entering
credentials checking for "https://" and padlock symbols, correct Bank domain,
and valid security certificates avoiding phishing sites. Suspicious
communications including emails, SMS, or calls requesting account information,
passwords, or urgent actions should be verified by contacting the Bank directly
through official channels before responding. Security alerts from the Bank
regarding unusual login attempts, device registrations, or transactions should
be reviewed immediately reporting unauthorized activities enables rapid response
and limiting damage.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall implement and maintain internationally recognized security
frameworks including ISO 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and OWASP
standards ensuring comprehensive security coverage. Security architecture
reviews conducted annually by independent experts assess design effectiveness,
identify vulnerabilities, and recommend enhancements keeping defenses current
against evolving threats. Penetration testing by ethical hackers performed
quarterly simulates real-world attacks identifying exploitable weaknesses before
malicious actors discover them enabling proactive remediation. Vulnerability
management includes continuous scanning, risk-based prioritization, and patching
of security vulnerabilities in systems and applications within defined
timeframes based on severity. Security Operations Center (SOC) monitors systems
24/7 analyzing logs, detecting anomalies, and responding to security events
providing real-time threat detection and incident response. Incident response
team with defined roles, communication protocols, and forensic capabilities
responds immediately to security incidents containing breaches, preserving
evidence, and minimizing customer impact. Customer security awareness campaigns
through SMS, emails, app notifications, and website content educate about
phishing, safe banking practices, and emerging threats empowering customers to
protect themselves. Secure software development lifecycle includes security
requirements definition, secure coding standards, code reviews, security
testing, and vulnerability remediation before production release preventing
introduction of vulnerabilities. Third-party security assessments verify that
vendors, service providers, and partners handling Bank data or services maintain
equivalent security standards through audits and contractual obligations.
Security metrics including incident frequency, vulnerability remediation times,
penetration test findings, and security training completion rates are tracked
monthly driving continuous improvement and accountability.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Perfect security is unattainable; despite best efforts, determined sophisticated
attackers may occasionally breach defenses; the Bank focuses on minimizing
likelihood, rapid detection, and effective response. Customer liability for
unauthorized transactions depends on circumstances including timely reporting,
credential compromise cause, and negligence assessment as per applicable
regulations and Bank policies. Security measures including transaction limits,
device restrictions, or enhanced authentication may cause occasional
inconvenience; these are necessary trade-offs between security and convenience.
System downtime for security maintenance including patching, upgrades, or
incident response may temporarily disrupt services; advance notifications
minimize inconvenience where feasible. Behavioral analytics and transaction
monitoring may occasionally generate false positives causing legitimate
transactions to be blocked requiring customer verification before release. The
Bank cannot guarantee security of customer devices, networks, or third-party
services used to access digital banking; customer-side security is outside
Bank's control requiring customer responsibility. Evolving threats require
continuous security investment and process evolution; measures adequate today
may require enhancement tomorrow necessitating regular policy and control
updates. Regulatory reporting of security incidents to State Bank, law
enforcement, or other authorities may occur without specific customer consent
when legally mandated or when incidents affect multiple customers.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan cyber security guidelines,
Electronic Transactions Ordinance, Payment Systems Operators and Payment Service
Providers Regulations, and international security standards. Information
security management system certified to ISO 27001 undergoes annual surveillance
audits by accredited certification bodies verifying ongoing compliance and
control effectiveness. The policy is reviewed semi-annually or immediately upon
major security incidents, regulatory updates, or significant threat landscape
changes ensuring relevance and adequacy. Security posture assessments by
independent cybersecurity firms conducted annually provide objective evaluation
of controls, identification of gaps, and benchmarking against industry best
practices. Cyber resilience exercises including disaster recovery drills,
incident response simulations, and business continuity tests conducted quarterly
validate response capabilities and identify improvement needs. Security training
for IT staff, developers, and operations teams is conducted quarterly with
specialized topics including secure coding, threat intelligence, and incident
response maintaining technical competencies. Board and senior management receive
quarterly cybersecurity briefings covering threat landscape, incident
statistics, security investments, and strategic risks ensuring governance
oversight. The Bank participates in industry information sharing forums,
computer emergency response teams (CERT), and cybersecurity alliances
collaborating on threat intelligence and collective defense.
Category 11: Record Retention and Data Handling Policies
11.1 Document Retention and Archival Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes systematic procedures for retaining, storing,
retrieving, and destroying customer records ensuring regulatory compliance,
operational efficiency, and evidence preservation. It balances retention needs
for legal protection with customer privacy through timely disposal. The policy
aims to maintain accessible records supporting business operations and
regulatory requirements while managing storage costs and data protection risks.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customer-related documents including account opening
forms, KYC documents, transaction records, loan files, correspondence,
agreements, statements, and audit trails maintained by Amanah Bank. It covers
physical records stored in branches and central archives, electronic records in
databases and document management systems, audio recordings of calls, video
surveillance footage, and email communications. The policy governs retention
periods, storage requirements, access controls, retrieval procedures, and secure
destruction methods. It applies across all departments and locations handling
customer records throughout the document lifecycle from creation to destruction.
3. Definitions
Record: Document or data capturing information about customer relationships,
transactions, decisions, or communications requiring preservation. Retention
Period: Minimum duration for which records must be preserved before eligible for
destruction. Active Records: Documents frequently accessed for current
operations stored in readily accessible locations. Archived Records: Historical
documents rarely accessed stored in lower-cost storage with retrieval processes.
Secure Destruction: Irreversible elimination of records preventing
reconstruction or unauthorized access after retention periods. Legal Hold:
Suspension of normal destruction schedules when records are relevant to
litigation or investigations. Document Management System (DMS): Electronic
repository organizing, storing, and managing documents with access controls and
audit trails.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank retains customer records for minimum periods prescribed by State
Bank regulations, tax laws, and legal statutes typically 10 years from account
closure or relationship termination ensuring compliance and evidence
preservation. Account opening documents including KYC forms, identification
copies, address proofs, and specimen signatures are retained for 10 years post-
account closure supporting verification if disputes arise. Transaction records
including deposit slips, withdrawal vouchers, transfer instructions, cheque
images, and electronic payment logs are retained for 10 years enabling
reconstruction of account history for audits or investigations. Loan
documentation including applications, credit assessments, approval memos,
agreements, collateral documents, and repayment records are retained for 10
years after loan closure or write-off supporting recovery actions and compliance
reviews. Audio recordings of customer service calls and video surveillance
footage are retained for 90 days unless involved in disputes or investigations
requiring extended preservation as evidence. Email communications and electronic
correspondence containing material customer interactions or decisions are
captured in document management systems and retained per relevant category
retention periods. Physical documents are stored in fireproof, secure archive
facilities with environmental controls, restricted access, and inventory
management preventing loss, damage, or unauthorized access. Electronic records
are maintained in secure databases with regular backups, disaster recovery
capabilities, encryption, and access controls ensuring availability and
confidentiality throughout retention periods. Records beyond retention periods
are destroyed securely through shredding for physical documents and degaussing
or cryptographic erasure for electronic media preventing data recovery. Legal
hold processes suspend normal destruction when records are relevant to ongoing
litigation, regulatory investigations, or internal inquiries preserving evidence
until legal matters conclude.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers should retain personal copies of account statements, transaction
receipts, loan agreements, and correspondence as the Bank's retention is for
compliance purposes, not indefinite customer service. Document retrieval
requests should specify exact timeframes, account numbers, and document types
enabling efficient search and retrieval from archives reducing costs and delays.
Customers requesting historical documents beyond 10 years of relationship
termination may face inability to retrieve records if destruction schedules have
completed; timely requests during retention periods are advisable. Certified
copies or document authentication services may incur fees as per the Bank's
published schedule; customers should budget accordingly for legal or regulatory
requirements needing authenticated records. During legal proceedings, customers
should inform the Bank if specific records are relevant enabling legal hold
placement preventing inadvertent destruction before matters resolve. Customers
should understand that certain records like call recordings have short retention
periods (90 days); disputes should be raised promptly while recordings exist for
investigation. Data subject access requests for historical records should
acknowledge retrieval complexities and potential delays for archived documents
stored off-site requiring logistics coordination.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain comprehensive retention schedules specifying
retention periods for each record category with legal and regulatory
justifications documented and approved by compliance and legal departments.
Records are classified during creation or receipt by record type enabling
automatic retention period assignment, storage location determination, and
destruction scheduling when systems permit. Active records supporting current
operations are maintained in branches, departments, or easily accessible
electronic systems with indexing enabling rapid retrieval during business hours.
Archived records are transferred to central archive facilities or electronic
archive systems annually consolidating inactive records, freeing operational
space, and optimizing storage costs. Physical archive facilities maintain
environmental controls (temperature, humidity), fire protection, pest control,
and security measures protecting records from deterioration, damage, or theft.
Electronic records management includes backup systems, disaster recovery sites,
format migration for technology evolution, and audit trails of access ensuring
long-term preservation and integrity. Retrieval processes respond to customer
requests, audit requirements, or legal demands within defined service levels
typically 5 business days for archives, with expedited options for urgent needs.
Destruction procedures include documented approvals, witnessed destruction for
physical records, certificate of destruction issuance, and audit trails ensuring
destruction occurs only for eligible records. Legal hold systems enable
immediate suspension of destruction schedules across all locations and formats
when litigation or investigations commence preventing evidence spoliation.
Periodic audits of retention compliance verify records are maintained for
required periods, destruction occurs timely after expiry, and no premature or
delayed destruction violations occur.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Longer retention periods apply when specific circumstances exist including
ongoing litigation, regulatory investigations, disputed transactions, or
customer bankruptcy proceedings requiring records as potential evidence. Shorter
retention periods for call recordings and surveillance footage balance storage
costs and privacy considerations with operational needs; customers should raise
issues promptly while such records exist. Tax-related documents may require
retention beyond standard periods if tax disputes, audits, or assessments extend
beyond typical closure timelines; legal advice guides retention extensions.
Customer consent cannot reduce statutory retention periods; even if customers
request deletion, minimum legal retention must complete before destruction
complying with regulatory obligations. Digital records in backup systems may
persist beyond active deletion due to backup rotation cycles; logical deletion
occurs immediately with physical erasure following backup schedules. Records
held by vendors, service providers, or third parties on the Bank's behalf are
subject to contractual retention and destruction obligations aligned with this
policy. Cross-border data flows for multinational customers or international
transactions may face conflicting retention requirements from multiple
jurisdictions; longer retention prevails balancing compliance across
jurisdictions. Historical records predating current retention schedules are
evaluated case-by-case balancing historical preservation with storage costs and
privacy considerations.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan record retention directives,
banking company ordinance requirements, tax documentation mandates, and legal
evidence preservation standards. Retention schedule accuracy is reviewed
annually incorporating regulatory changes, new product records, and operational
lessons ensuring comprehensive coverage of all record categories. Compliance
audits conducted semi-annually verify records are maintained for required
periods through sampling of active and archived records across categories and
locations. Destruction audit trails are reviewed quarterly confirming only
eligible records are destroyed with proper approvals, documentation, and
certificates of destruction maintained. The policy is updated promptly when
regulatory changes mandate retention period revisions ensuring immediate
compliance with new requirements. Technology investments in document management
systems, electronic archival, and automated retention workflows are prioritized
reducing manual effort and improving compliance accuracy. Staff training on
record retention, classification, handling, and destruction protocols is
conducted annually for employees involved in record management ensuring
consistent application. The Bank consults with legal advisors regarding
retention practices, legal hold management, and destruction procedures ensuring
defensible practices withstanding legal scrutiny.

Policies
12.1 Foreign Exchange and International Transaction Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for foreign exchange
transactions, international remittances, and cross-border payments ensuring
regulatory compliance, competitive pricing, and customer convenience. It aims to
facilitate legitimate foreign exchange needs while preventing money laundering,
terrorist financing, and unauthorized capital flight. The policy balances
customer access to forex services with prudent risk management and regulatory
adherence.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all foreign exchange services offered by Amanah Bank
including currency exchange, outward remittances, inward remittances, foreign
currency accounts, travel forex, import/export financing, and foreign currency
demand drafts. It covers foreign exchange rate determination, documentation
requirements, transaction limits, purpose codes, reporting obligations, and
compliance procedures. The policy governs transactions for individuals,
businesses, exporters, importers, and non-resident Pakistanis across all
branches authorized for foreign exchange operations. It excludes derivative
transactions and treasury operations which are governed by separate wholesale
banking policies.
3. Definitions
Foreign Exchange (Forex): Conversion between Pakistani Rupees and foreign
currencies or between different foreign currencies. Exchange Rate: Price at
which one currency exchanges for another determined by market forces and Bank
margins. Outward Remittance: Transfer of funds from Pakistan to foreign
countries for permissible purposes. Inward Remittance: Receipt of funds into
Pakistan from foreign sources. Authorized Dealer: Bank licensed by State Bank of
Pakistan to conduct foreign exchange transactions. Foreign Currency Account:
Bank account denominated in foreign currencies enabling holding and transactions
in forex. SWIFT: Secure messaging network for international payment instructions
between banks. Nostro Account: Foreign currency account held by Amanah Bank with
correspondent banks abroad facilitating international transactions.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank as an Authorized Dealer facilitates legitimate foreign exchange
transactions in compliance with Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, State Bank
directives, and international sanctions ensuring customer convenience within
regulatory frameworks. Foreign exchange rates for customer transactions include
inter-bank market rates plus reasonable spreads covering costs, risks, and
margins published daily on the Bank's website, mobile app, and displayed at
branches. Outward remittances up to USD 25,000 annually per individual for
permissible purposes including education fees, medical treatment, family
maintenance, investments, and travel are processed based on declarations without
prior State Bank approval. Remittances exceeding annual limits or for restricted
purposes require State Bank approval obtained through the Bank with supporting
documentation justifying the remittance purpose and amount. Inward remittances
have no limits and are freely credited to customer accounts or paid in cash
after verifying beneficiary identity, source legitimacy through correspondent
bank certifications, and compliance with sanctions screening. Foreign Currency
Accounts allow individuals and businesses to maintain balances in major
currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) earning minimal interest with flexibility for
international transactions without immediate conversion to PKR. Travel forex up
to USD 10,000 per trip is provided in cash or travel cards based on ticket
verification, passport, and visa documentation facilitating legitimate travel
needs. Export proceeds must be repatriated within 180 days of shipment; delayed
realization requires State Bank reporting and extension applications ensuring
export earnings return to Pakistan. Import payments are processed against
shipping documents, customs declarations, and commercial invoices verifying
transaction legitimacy and preventing over-invoicing capital flight. Enhanced
due diligence applies to foreign exchange transactions involving high-risk
countries, politically exposed persons, large amounts, or unusual patterns
detecting potential money laundering or sanctions violations.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate information regarding remittance purposes using
correct purpose codes enabling proper regulatory reporting and compliance with
foreign exchange regulations. Supporting documents including invoices, admission
letters, medical reports, property documents, or relationship proof must be
genuine and submitted for outward remittances facilitating verification and
approval. Travel forex requests should be made at least 2 business days before
travel allowing adequate time for currency procurement, documentation
verification, and compliance processes. Foreign Currency Accounts should be used
for legitimate international transactions; misuse for speculation, unauthorized
trading, or circumventing regulations violates terms and may result in account
closure. Export proceeds must be repatriated promptly within regulatory
timelines; exporters facing delays should proactively seek extensions rather
than defaulting on repatriation obligations. Import documentation must
accurately reflect transaction values, quantities, and purposes; false
declarations to obtain excess forex constitute fraud punishable under law.
Customers should compare exchange rates across banks and money changers
understanding that rates vary based on currencies, amounts, and transaction
types enabling informed decisions. Inward remittance recipients must provide
complete identification, source information, and intended use facilitating AML
compliance and sanctions screening before funds release.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall display current foreign exchange rates prominently on digital
channels and at branches with transparent disclosure of spreads, fees, and
charges enabling customer price comparison. Forex transactions are processed
efficiently within 1-2 business days for standard cases and 5-7 business days
for transactions requiring State Bank approvals providing timely service. The
Bank verifies supporting documents thoroughly including invoices, contracts, and
certificates authenticating transaction legitimacy and compliance with purpose-
specific documentation requirements. Outward remittances are transmitted through
SWIFT network to correspondent banks with complete beneficiary information,
purpose codes, and regulatory references ensuring successful crediting abroad.
Inward remittances are screened against sanctions lists, verified for source
legitimacy, and credited to beneficiary accounts or disbursed in cash within 24
hours of receipt barring compliance holds. Foreign Currency Account operations
include monthly statements, internet banking access, and international payment
capabilities providing convenient forex management for customers. The Bank
maintains adequate foreign currency liquidity through nostro accounts with major
correspondent banks globally ensuring ability to fulfill customer forex
requirements promptly. Customer education on foreign exchange regulations,
documentation requirements, and permissible purposes is provided through
relationship managers, website content, and informational brochures. Suspicious
forex transactions including structuring, unusual patterns, or inconsistent
documentation are reported to Financial Monitoring Unit as Suspicious
Transaction Reports per AML obligations. Regulatory reporting including daily
forex position reports, transaction-level reporting to State Bank, and
compliance with concentration limits ensures institutional compliance and
license maintenance.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Foreign exchange rates fluctuate continuously based on market dynamics; rates
quoted are indicative and final rates apply at transaction execution potentially
causing slight variations. Large forex transactions exceeding USD 100,000
equivalent may require advance booking allowing the Bank to manage liquidity and
obtain competitive rates through treasury operations. Certain currencies from
high-risk jurisdictions or less-traded currencies may face limited availability,
wider spreads, or longer processing times due to correspondent banking
constraints. Forex transactions to sanctioned countries, entities, or
individuals are strictly prohibited; the Bank cannot process such transactions
regardless of customer intent or stated purposes. Outward remittances for
certain purposes including real estate purchases abroad, stock trading in
foreign markets, or business investments may require State Bank approvals beyond
Bank's authority. Exchange rate movements during transaction processing may
cause final amounts to differ from initial estimates; customers bear currency
fluctuation risks during processing periods. Forex services may be temporarily
unavailable during correspondent bank holidays, SWIFT network maintenance, or
when regulatory directives mandate temporary restrictions. Nostro account
charges, correspondent bank fees, and intermediary bank deductions are beyond
the Bank's control and may reduce amounts received by overseas beneficiaries.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, State Bank of
Pakistan foreign exchange operations regulations, FATF recommendations on cross-
border payments, and international sanctions regimes. Forex operations undergo
monthly compliance reviews verifying documentation adequacy, purpose code
accuracy, regulatory reporting completeness, and adherence to transaction
limits. The policy is reviewed quarterly incorporating regulatory changes,
correspondent banking updates, sanctions list additions, and operational
efficiency improvements. Forex transaction statistics including volume trends,
currency compositions, purpose distributions, and rejected transactions are
analyzed monthly informing liquidity management and compliance risk assessment.
Customer complaints regarding exchange rates, processing delays, or
documentation requirements are investigated within 5 business days with
explanations and resolution where Bank errors exist. Staff training on foreign
exchange regulations, documentation requirements, sanctions screening, and AML
red flags is conducted quarterly ensuring consistent compliance and customer
service. The Bank maintains updated sanctions lists, high-risk jurisdiction
lists, and regulatory guidelines ensuring real-time compliance screening of all
forex transactions. Correspondent banking relationships are reviewed annually
assessing service quality, competitive pricing, compliance standards, and
strategic alignment ensuring optimal partnerships for customer service.
12.2 Non-Resident and Overseas Pakistani Banking Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes specialized banking services for Non-Resident Pakistanis
(NRPs) and Overseas Pakistanis facilitating remittances, investments, and
banking relationships while complying with foreign exchange regulations. It aims
to attract remittances supporting Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves while
providing convenient financial services to the diaspora. The policy balances
regulatory requirements with customer-friendly procedures recognizing unique
needs of overseas Pakistanis.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all banking services for Pakistani citizens residing
abroad including Non-Resident Rupee Accounts, Foreign Currency Accounts, Roshan
Digital Accounts, remittance services, property financing, investment
facilitation, and repatriation rights. It covers account opening procedures for
non-residents, documentation requirements, transaction permissions, tax
treatment, and regulatory compliance. The policy governs services across
branches, digital channels, and overseas representative offices. It applies to
Pakistani passport holders residing abroad, Pakistani origin foreign nationals,
and returning overseas Pakistanis establishing banking relationships remotely or
through branch visits during home visits.
3. Definitions
Non-Resident Pakistani (NRP): Pakistani citizen residing abroad for employment,
business, or permanent settlement. Overseas Pakistani: Pakistani national living
outside Pakistan including temporary workers, students, and permanent
expatriates. Non-Resident Rupee Account (NRA): PKR-denominated account for non-
residents with special repatriation privileges. Foreign Currency Account (FCA):
Dollar/Euro/Pound account for non-residents maintaining foreign exchange. Roshan
Digital Account: State Bank initiative enabling overseas Pakistanis to open
accounts digitally without physical presence. Repatriation: Transfer of funds
from Pakistan to overseas destinations without restrictions. Remittance:
Transfer of money by overseas Pakistanis to Pakistan supporting families or
investments.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank offers specialized banking solutions for Non-Resident Pakistanis
recognizing their valuable contributions to Pakistan's economy through
remittances and investments deserving preferential treatment and convenience.
Roshan Digital Account enables complete digital account opening from abroad
without physical presence using video KYC, passport verification, and overseas
address documentation providing banking access from anywhere globally. Non-
Resident Rupee Accounts allow PKR deposits and transactions with unrestricted
repatriation rights meaning funds can be transferred back overseas anytime
without State Bank approval unlike resident accounts. Foreign Currency Accounts
maintain balances in USD, EUR, or GBP without forced conversion to PKR enabling
expatriates to save foreign earnings and conduct international transactions
conveniently. Inward remittances from overseas Pakistanis receive preferential
treatment with zero charges, competitive exchange rates, instant credit, and
promotional incentives encouraging continued remittance flows through banking
channels. Investment facilitation includes access to Treasury Bills, Pakistan
Investment Bonds, mutual funds, and stock market investments from abroad with
simplified procedures and repatriation guarantees. Property financing enables
overseas Pakistanis to purchase or construct property in Pakistan with special
schemes offering favorable terms, flexible documentation, and rent-based
repayment options. Returning overseas Pakistanis receive assistance in account
conversion, settlement services, and tax guidance facilitating smooth transition
from non-resident to resident status. Special relationship managers dedicated to
non-resident banking provide personalized service, handle documentation
complexities, and ensure seamless banking experiences for diaspora customers.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Non-resident customers must provide valid Pakistani passport, overseas residence
proof (visa/work permit/utility bill), and tax residency documentation for
account opening and ongoing compliance. Customers should maintain their non-
resident status genuinely; returning to Pakistan permanently requires
notification within 60 days and account conversion to resident status per
regulations. Inward remittances should be genuine personal transfers or
legitimate business proceeds; using NRP accounts for third-party remittances or
trade financing without proper authorization violates regulations. Property
financing borrowers must ensure rental income, overseas salary, or legitimate
sources service EMIs; default affects creditworthiness and relationship with the
Bank. Investment decisions should be based on personal financial assessment,
risk tolerance, and professional advice; the Bank provides facilitation but not
investment recommendations warranting returns. Tax obligations in residence
countries regarding Pakistani source income, investments, or property are
customer responsibilities; the Bank provides withholding services for Pakistan
taxes only. Communication channels including email addresses, phone numbers, and
overseas addresses must be kept current enabling the Bank to reach customers for
important notifications or compliance requirements. Upon returning to Pakistan,
customers must notify the Bank promptly facilitating account status conversion
and ensuring continued regulatory compliance under resident banking rules.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall provide simplified account opening through digital channels
with video KYC, electronic document submission, and remote identity verification
eliminating physical visit requirements for overseas customers. The Bank
verifies overseas address and residence status through documents like utility
bills, residence permits, or employer letters ensuring genuine non-resident
status per regulatory definitions. Foreign exchange conversion for remittances
offers competitive rates with transparent spreads incentivizing remittances
through formal banking channels rather than informal hundi/hawala networks.
Funds in Non-Resident accounts are freely repatriable; the Bank processes
outward remittances without State Bank approval requirements or purpose
restrictions up to available balances. Investment facilitation includes
assistance with documentation, online trading platform access, portfolio
management services, and guidance on repatriation procedures for investment
proceeds. Property financing processes include overseas income verification,
flexible documentation acceptance, construction monitoring for development
loans, and customer-friendly policies recognizing distance challenges. Dedicated
relationship managers maintain regular communication through emails, video
calls, and home country visits where feasible building strong relationships and
addressing concerns proactively. The Bank collaborates with overseas
correspondents, exchange companies, and remittance platforms offering multiple
convenient channels for sending money to Pakistan with instant credit. Tax
guidance including withholding tax implications, treaty benefits, and compliance
requirements is provided assisting customers in understanding and meeting
Pakistan tax obligations. Annual newsletters, webinars, and digital content keep
overseas customers informed about product updates, regulatory changes, and
investment opportunities in Pakistan maintaining engagement.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Non-resident status requires genuine overseas residence; temporary visits to
Pakistan don't affect status, but permanent return requires account conversion
within 60 days under regulations. Repatriation rights for NRP accounts apply to
funds originating from overseas remittances, foreign currency conversions, or
permissible investments; local PKR income may face restrictions. Investment
returns including capital gains, dividends, or profit on debt instruments are
subject to applicable withholding taxes; treaty benefits require tax residency
certificates from foreign tax authorities. Property financing eligibility
requires stable overseas income, satisfactory credit history, and appropriate
debt-to-income ratios; financing isn't guaranteed merely based on non-resident
status. Foreign exchange regulations may change based on State Bank policy
shifts, balance of payments situations, or economic conditions potentially
affecting account features or transaction freedoms. Correspondent bank
relationships enable international remittances; disruptions in correspondent
banking due to sanctions, de-risking, or compliance issues may affect service
availability temporarily. Roshan Digital Accounts have operational limits
initially including transaction caps and phased feature rollouts; full-service
parity with conventional accounts develops progressively as systems mature. Tax
residency in foreign countries may create tax reporting obligations for those
jurisdictions; some countries require disclosure of foreign accounts and assets
with customer responsibility for compliance.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with Foreign Exchange Regulation Act provisions on non-
resident accounts, State Bank of Pakistan regulations on Roshan Digital
Accounts, and international best practices in diaspora banking. Non-resident
account operations undergo quarterly compliance audits verifying genuine non-
resident status, proper documentation, repatriation right adherence, and
regulatory reporting accuracy. The policy is reviewed semi-annually
incorporating State Bank policy changes, Roshan Digital Account guideline
updates, and customer feedback on overseas banking experiences. Remittance
volumes, account growth statistics, investment flows, and property financing
uptake are monitored monthly assessing policy effectiveness and informing
product development. Customer complaints regarding account opening difficulties,
repatriation delays, or service quality are investigated within 7 business days
with resolution and system improvements where needed. Staff training on non-
resident banking regulations, Roshan Digital Account procedures, and diaspora
customer service nuances is conducted quarterly ensuring knowledgeable,
empathetic service delivery. The Bank participates in State Bank initiatives,
overseas Pakistani conventions, and diaspora engagement programs strengthening
relationships and promoting formal banking channel usage. Technology investments
in digital onboarding, video KYC, remote service delivery, and mobile banking
enhancements are prioritized improving overseas customer experiences
continuously.
Category 13: Consent and Authorization Policies
13.1 Customer Consent and Authorization Management Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive frameworks for obtaining, recording,
managing, and honoring customer consents and authorizations ensuring
transparent, voluntary agreements for data processing, marketing communications,
and transaction executions. It protects customer autonomy while enabling
legitimate Bank operations through proper consent mechanisms. The policy aims to
build trust through respect for customer choices and preferences across all
interactions.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all situations requiring customer consent including
account opening terms, data processing beyond core banking, marketing
communications, third-party data sharing, standing instructions, auto-debit
mandates, and authorized signatory designations. It covers consent capture
methods, documentation requirements, revocation procedures, consent renewal, and
record-keeping obligations. The policy governs consents across all channels
including written forms, electronic acceptances, verbal recordings, and
biometric authentications. It applies to all customer types including
individuals, joint account holders, minor accounts, and corporate customers with
appropriate authority verification.
3. Definitions
Consent: Informed, voluntary agreement by customer for specific purposes or
actions. Informed Consent: Agreement based on clear understanding of
implications, purposes, and rights regarding what is being consented to.
Explicit Consent: Clear affirmative action (signature, checkbox, verbal yes)
indicating agreement as opposed to implied or assumed consent. Opt-In: Consent
mechanism requiring customer to actively choose to participate in optional
services like marketing communications. Opt-Out: Mechanism enabling customers to
withdraw from services or communications they previously consented to. Standing
Instruction: Pre-authorized recurring transaction instruction executed
automatically per specified schedule. Authorization: Specific permission to
execute transactions or access accounts on customer's behalf.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank obtains explicit customer consent for all material matters affecting
customer rights, data usage, or obligations ensuring decisions are informed,
voluntary, and properly documented. Account opening requires consent to general
terms and conditions with clear explanations of customer obligations, Bank
rights, fees, interest rates, and dispute resolution mechanisms provided before
signature. Data processing consents distinguish between mandatory processing for
core banking services and optional processing for marketing, analytics, or
third-party sharing with separate opt-in mechanisms for optional uses. Marketing
communication consent is obtained separately for different channels (SMS, email,
phone calls) with clear opt-out instructions in every communication honoring
customer preferences promptly. Standing instructions and auto-debit mandates
require written authorization specifying beneficiary details, amounts (fixed or
variable within limits), frequency, and duration with revocation rights clearly
disclosed. Third-party data sharing beyond regulatory requirements or core
service delivery requires explicit consent naming the third parties, purposes,
and data categories being shared. Authorized signatories for accounts require
proper documentation including identity verification, authority limits, and
revocation procedures ensuring only legitimately authorized persons access
accounts. Consent forms use clear, simple language avoiding legal jargon or fine
print strategies; material terms are highlighted ensuring customers understand
what they're agreeing to. Digital consents through checkboxes, electronic
signatures, or click-through agreements are legally valid and enforceable
equivalent to physical signatures when proper authentication and record-keeping
exist. Consent revocation rights are respected promptly typically within 3
business days of notification; customers can withdraw consents for optional
services anytime without relationship termination threats.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must read consent documents carefully before signing or clicking
acceptance understanding rights, obligations, and implications of agreements
being entered. Questions or unclear terms should be clarified with Bank staff
before providing consent; signing without understanding creates risks of
unintended obligations or consequences. Authorized signatory designations should
be considered carefully selecting trustworthy individuals with appropriate
authority levels and monitoring their activities regularly. Standing
instructions and auto-debits require sufficient balance maintenance on due
dates; customers are responsible for fund availability preventing bounced
payments and associated charges. Consent revocations should be communicated
formally through proper channels (written requests, authenticated digital
submissions) rather than informal mentions for effective processing. Changes in
circumstances affecting consents including revocation of authorized signatory
authority, cancellation of standing instructions, or marketing preference
updates should be notified promptly. Customers should retain copies of consent
documents, authorization letters, and revocation requests as proof of agreements
and instructions for future reference or dispute resolution. Consents given
should be genuine and voluntary; providing consent under pressure,
misunderstanding, or for accessing services being denied creates complications
and potential disputes.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall design consent mechanisms ensuring information is clear,
prominent, and understandable to average customers avoiding technical jargon or
complex legal language. Material terms affecting customer rights or obligations
are highlighted using bold text, larger fonts, or summary boxes drawing
attention before detailed terms and conditions. Consent forms separate mandatory
consents required for service delivery from optional consents for value-added
services enabling customers to decline optional consents without service denial.
Digital consent interfaces include scroll-to-bottom requirements, key terms
acceptance, and confirmation screens ensuring customers cannot accidentally
accept without reviewing content. The Bank maintains comprehensive consent
records including signed forms, electronic acceptance logs with timestamps and
IP addresses, and audio recordings of verbal consents for audit and dispute
resolution. Consent revocations are processed promptly typically within 3
business days with confirmations sent to customers and system updates preventing
further processing contrary to revoked consents. Periodic consent reviews prompt
customers to reconfirm or update preferences especially for marketing
communications ensuring consents remain current and reflect customer wishes.
Staff training on consent procedures, explanation requirements, and proper
documentation ensures consistent consent capture across all branches and
channels. The Bank does not employ dark patterns, misleading interfaces, or
coercive practices to obtain consents; all consent mechanisms prioritize
customer understanding and voluntary agreement. Customers exercising revocation
rights do not face retaliation, service deterioration, or relationship strain;
the Bank respects customer autonomy in managing consents and preferences.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Certain processing activities are permitted without explicit consent based on
legal obligations (AML reporting, tax compliance), contractual necessity
(payment processing), or legitimate interests (fraud prevention) under data
protection principles. Consent for account opening terms and conditions is
required for establishing banking relationships; declining fundamental terms
prevents account opening as agreements form contractual basis. Revocation of
consents central to service delivery (account terms, transaction authorizations)
effectively terminates the service or relationship requiring account closure or
service discontinuation. Marketing consent revocations are honored for future
communications; communications already sent or in-process at revocation time
cannot be recalled but subsequent communications cease. Standing instruction
cancellations require advance notice (typically 3 business days) allowing time
for system updates; payments initiated before cancellation process may execute.
Authorized signatory revocations don't affect transactions already executed by
those persons before revocation; only future transactions are prevented
requiring careful timing of revocations. Consents cannot override statutory
rights or legal protections; provisions attempting to waive customer rights to
complaint, legal recourse, or regulatory protection are void regardless of
consent. Minor consents require guardian authorization with specific limitations
on scope protecting minor interests; certain high-risk authorizations may be
declined regardless of guardian consent.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with Electronic Transactions Ordinance provisions on
electronic consents, State Bank consumer protection guidelines on transparent
agreements, and international standards on consent management. Consent capture
processes undergo annual audits verifying forms are clear and complete, staff
provide adequate explanations, and documentation is properly maintained. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory changes, customer feedback
on consent processes, and best practices in consent user experience design.
Consent management systems track consent status, revocation requests, and
processing timelines with dashboards monitoring compliance with revocation
processing commitments. Customer complaints regarding consent processes, unclear
terms, or revocation difficulties are investigated within 5 business days with
process improvements for systemic issues. Staff training on consent principles,
explanation techniques, documentation requirements, and revocation handling is
conducted semi-annually ensuring competency. The Bank benchmarks consent
practices against peer institutions and international standards continuously
improving consent user experience and legal robustness. Technology investments
in consent management platforms, digital signature solutions, and preference
centers are prioritized enabling efficient, customer-friendly consent
administration.
C. Customer Experience and Service Policies
Category 14: Service and Fee Disclosure Policies
14.1 Service Level Agreement and Performance Standards Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes quantitative service level commitments for key banking
services creating accountability and transparency regarding service delivery
expectations. It enables customers to assess Bank performance objectively while
driving internal excellence through measurable targets. The policy aims to build
confidence through consistent service delivery meeting or exceeding published
standards.
2. Scope
This policy applies to service level agreements for critical customer
touchpoints including account opening, loan processing, payment transactions,
complaint resolution, card issuance, cheque clearing, and customer service
responsiveness. It covers service availability commitments, processing
timelines, error rates, and compensation mechanisms for breaches. The policy
governs performance measurement, reporting, and continuous improvement
processes. It applies across all branches, digital channels, and service centers
with segment-specific variations for retail and corporate customers.
3. Definitions
Service Level Agreement (SLA): Quantified commitment regarding service
performance dimensions like speed, accuracy, or availability. Turnaround Time
(TAT): Maximum time duration for completing specific services or transactions
from initiation to conclusion. Uptime: Percentage of time digital services
remain available and functional excluding planned maintenance. Service Breach:
Failure to meet published service level commitments requiring investigation and
potential compensation. Compensation: Financial or service remedy provided to
customers when service levels are not met due to Bank failures. Performance
Dashboard: Real-time monitoring system tracking actual performance against SLA
targets enabling proactive management.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank publishes quantified service level commitments for key services on
its website, mobile app, and branch displays creating transparent performance
expectations customers can rely upon. Account opening for standard savings or
current accounts completes within 3 business days of complete documentation
submission with instant account number provisioning for digital account
openings. Personal loan applications receive credit decisions within 5 business
days of complete documentation with disbursement within 2 business days post-
approval ensuring timely access to credit. Domestic fund transfers submitted
before cut-off times (IBFT by 5 PM, RTGS by 3 PM) complete same business day
with beneficiary credit typically within 30 minutes during banking hours.
Customer service calls are answered within 60 seconds on average with maximum
wait time not exceeding 3 minutes for 95% of calls maintaining responsive
support. Complaint acknowledgments occur within 24 hours of registration with
resolution within 5 business days for simple matters and 15 business days for
complex issues providing time-bound redressal. ATM and debit card issuance

business day) with funds available by next business day providing predictable
fund availability. Service level breaches caused by Bank systems, processes, or
staff errors result in compensation including fee waivers, interest adjustments,
or goodwill credits proportionate to inconvenience. Performance against service
levels is published quarterly on the Bank's website demonstrating accountability
and transparency in service delivery enabling customer assessment of performance
trends.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide complete, accurate documentation at service initiation
enabling the Bank to meet processing timelines; incomplete submissions restart
turnaround time clocks. Service level commitments apply to standard cases;
complex situations involving exceptions, investigations, or third-party
dependencies may require extended timelines beyond SLAs. Customers should
initiate time-sensitive services with adequate lead time considering SLA
commitments; last-minute requests may not meet personal deadlines even if within
SLAs. Planned maintenance windows for digital services communicated in advance
are excluded from uptime calculations; customers should plan around announced
maintenance for critical transactions. Service level complaints should specify
which SLA was breached, provide evidence (timestamps, reference numbers), and
allow investigation before demanding compensation. Customers bear responsibility
for transaction accuracy (beneficiary details, amounts, purposes); the Bank's
SLA covers processing speed not error correction from customer mistakes.
Multiple service requests submitted simultaneously compete for resources;
customers should prioritize critical services when submitting several requests
concurrently. Service level commitments apply to transactions meeting regulatory
and policy requirements; suspicious transactions or compliance holds may extend
timelines beyond SLAs for legitimate risk management.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall design service processes with adequate capacity, technology
automation, and staff resources ensuring consistent achievement of published
service level commitments. Real-time performance dashboards monitor SLA
compliance across services and locations with alerts when targets are at risk
enabling proactive intervention before breaches. Root cause analysis is
conducted for service level breaches identifying systemic issues, process
bottlenecks, technology limitations, or training gaps requiring corrective
action. Customers experiencing service level breaches receive proactive
communication explaining delays, revised timelines, and compensation eligibility
demonstrating accountability and customer care. Compensation for SLA breaches is
provided automatically where possible or upon customer request after breach
verification typically including fee waivers, interest credits, or service fee
refunds. Service level targets are reviewed quarterly based on performance data,
industry benchmarks, and customer expectations with targets tightened as
capabilities improve driving continuous excellence. Technology investments
prioritize service delivery improvements including process automation, system
upgrades, and digital channel enhancements enabling faster, more reliable
service. Staff performance evaluations incorporate SLA achievement metrics
creating accountability at individual and team levels for service delivery
excellence. Customer feedback on service delivery through surveys, complaints,
and social media is analyzed identifying perception gaps between actual
performance and customer experience. The Bank communicates service improvements,
SLA enhancements, and performance achievements proactively building confidence
and differentiating service quality in the competitive marketplace.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Force majeure events including natural disasters, civil unrest, pandemics, or
large-scale technology failures exempt the Bank from SLA commitments during
impact periods. Regulatory investigations, law enforcement holds, or court
orders may require transaction delays or account freezes beyond SLA control
prioritizing legal compliance over service speed. Third-party dependencies
including correspondent banks, payment networks, clearing houses, or vendor
systems sometimes cause delays beyond the Bank's direct control. Complex
transactions requiring manual processing, senior management approvals, or
detailed investigations naturally take longer than standard transactions
reflected in published SLAs. Seasonal volumes during peak periods (month-end,
holidays, salary days) may strain capacity causing temporary service slowdowns
despite best efforts to maintain standards. Incomplete documentation, customer
non-responsiveness to queries, or pending clarifications pause SLA clocks;
timelines resume only after customer provides required inputs. Service level
commitments represent targets and typical performance; individual transactions
may occasionally exceed timelines without compensation unless patterns indicate
systemic failures. Digital service uptime calculations exclude planned
maintenance, customer internet connectivity issues, and problems originating
from customer devices or software.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan service quality guidelines,
customer service standards, and international best practices in banking service
level management. Service level performance undergoes monthly monitoring with
detailed reports to senior management highlighting trends, breaches, root
causes, and improvement initiatives. The policy is reviewed semi-annually
incorporating performance insights, competitive benchmarking, regulatory
expectations, and customer feedback on service experiences. Mystery shopping
exercises assess actual service delivery against published SLAs testing whether
branch and call center experiences align with commitments. Customer surveys
specifically assess awareness of service level commitments and satisfaction with
actual delivery identifying gaps between promise and perception. Staff training
on service excellence, time management, prioritization, and customer
communication ensures consistent understanding and commitment to SLA
achievement. Technology performance including system response times,
availability, and transaction processing speeds is monitored continuously with
infrastructure upgrades prioritized for bottleneck elimination. The Bank
celebrates SLA achievements publicly and internally recognizing teams and
individuals delivering exceptional service excellence creating a performance-
driven culture.
14.2 Product Suitability and Responsible Selling Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes principles and procedures for recommending suitable
banking products aligned with customer needs, risk profiles, and financial
capabilities preventing mis-selling and exploitation. It ensures customer
interests guide product recommendations rather than sales targets or revenue
considerations. The policy aims to build long-term relationships through
appropriate product matching enhancing customer satisfaction and financial
wellness.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all product sales interactions including account opening,
loan origination, credit card issuance, investment product sales, insurance
distribution, and cross-selling activities at Amanah Bank. It covers needs
assessment procedures, suitability evaluation criteria, product comparison
disclosure, risk explanation requirements, and post-sale reviews. The policy
governs staff conduct, incentive structure alignment, supervision mechanisms,
and consequence management for mis-selling. It applies to all distribution
channels including branches, call centers, digital platforms, and third-party
agents selling Bank products.
3. Definitions
Suitability: Appropriateness of a product for a customer based on needs, risk
tolerance, financial capacity, and understanding. Needs Assessment: Process of
understanding customer financial situation, goals, risk appetite, and
preferences before product recommendations. Mis-Selling: Recommending or selling
unsuitable products through misrepresentation, omission of material facts, or
pressure tactics prioritizing sales over suitability. Product Disclosure:
Comprehensive explanation of product features, costs, risks, alternatives, and
consequences enabling informed decisions. Cooling-Off Period: Time after product
purchase allowing cancellation without penalties enabling reflection on purchase
decisions. Vulnerable Customer: Individual requiring special consideration due
to age, financial literacy, distress, or circumstances affecting decision-making
capacity.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank prioritizes product suitability over sales volume ensuring customer
needs and capabilities guide recommendations creating value for customers and
sustainable relationships for the Bank. Comprehensive needs assessment precedes
product recommendations involving discussions about financial goals, income
stability, existing obligations, risk tolerance, and product understanding
determining suitable options. Product recommendations present multiple options
when available explaining differences, trade-offs, costs, and risks enabling
customers to choose products matching their priorities rather than pushing
single options. Complex or high-risk products including market-linked
investments, long-term commitments, or variable-rate loans receive enhanced
suitability assessment with documented rationale and supervisory oversight.
Product disclosures use clear, simple language highlighting key features, costs,
risks, and exit options; marketing promises are substantiated, and risks are
prominently disclosed not buried in fine print. Vulnerable customers including
seniors, low-income segments, distressed borrowers, or financially
unsophisticated individuals receive special consideration with patient
explanations, family involvement encouragement, and conservative product
recommendations. Cooling-off periods allow customers to cancel products within
specified periods (typically 7-14 days) without penalties for products involving
long-term commitments or significant financial implications. Sales incentives
reward suitability compliance, customer satisfaction scores, and relationship
longevity rather than purely volume-based metrics preventing mis-selling
pressures from compensation structures. Supervisory reviews include transaction
monitoring, customer callback programs, and complaint analysis detecting
potential mis-selling requiring investigation, remediation, and staff
consequences. Customers receive post-sale communications confirming product
features, costs, rights, and contact points for queries ensuring understanding
persists beyond the sales moment and enabling early issue detection.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate, complete information about financial situation,
goals, risk tolerance, and existing obligations enabling appropriate suitability
assessment and product recommendations. Customers should actively participate in
needs assessment discussions asking questions, expressing concerns, and honestly
communicating preferences rather than passive acceptance of recommendations.
Product disclosures, terms and conditions, and risk explanations should be read
carefully before purchase; signing without understanding creates risks of
unsuitable products and financial difficulties. Customers should compare product
options considering not just benefits but also costs, risks, commitments, and
exit penalties making holistic assessments rather than focusing narrowly on
attractive features. If feeling pressured, rushed, orRetrySMContinue5. Customer
Responsibilities (continued)
If feeling pressured, rushed, or uncertain about product recommendations,
customers should request time to consider, seek second opinions, or consult
family members before committing to purchases. Cooling-off period rights should
be exercised promptly if post-purchase reflection reveals unsuitability,
misunderstanding, or changed circumstances enabling product cancellation without
penalties. Changes in financial circumstances affecting ability to maintain
products (income loss, increased obligations, health issues) should be
communicated to the Bank enabling proactive adjustments or alternatives.
Customers should monitor product performance, review statements, and assess
whether products continue meeting needs over time requesting reviews or switches
when circumstances change. Mis-selling suspicions including misrepresentation,
omitted risk disclosure, or pressure tactics should be reported through
complaint channels enabling investigation and remediation.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall implement structured needs assessment frameworks requiring
staff to document customer financial situation, goals, risk appetite, and
product understanding before recommendations. Suitability evaluation matrices
map customer profiles to appropriate products with clear criteria for matching
ensuring consistent, objective product recommendations across staff and
locations. Product comparison tools enable staff to present multiple suitable
options with side-by-side feature, cost, and risk comparisons empowering
customers to make informed choices. Risk disclosure scripts and materials ensure
consistent communication of product risks, worst-case scenarios, and exit costs
preventing selective disclosure or risk minimization. Supervisory oversight
includes pre-approval requirements for high-risk products, random transaction
reviews, and customer callback programs verifying suitability compliance and
customer satisfaction. The Bank conducts post-sale reviews contacting customers
after product purchase to confirm understanding, satisfaction, and absence of
mis-selling providing early detection and remediation opportunities. Complaint
analysis identifies patterns suggesting mis-selling by specific staff, branches,
or product types triggering investigations, corrective actions, and potential
staff consequences. Staff training on needs assessment techniques, product
knowledge, ethical selling, and regulatory requirements is conducted quarterly
ensuring competency and compliance. Incentive structures balance volume targets
with quality metrics including suitability compliance rates, customer
satisfaction scores, complaint rates, and retention rates preventing pure
volume-driven selling. The Bank maintains comprehensive sales records including
needs assessment documentation, product recommendations, customer
acknowledgments, and suitability rationale enabling audit trails and dispute
resolution.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Suitability assessment depth varies by product complexity; simple products like
basic savings accounts require less extensive assessment than complex
investments or long-term credit commitments. Customer insistence on specific
products deemed marginally unsuitable may be accommodated with enhanced
disclosure, documented acknowledgment of unsuitability reasons, and management
approval. Products with regulatory suitability requirements (investments,
insurance) face stricter assessment standards and mandatory documentation
compared to standard banking products. Suitability is point-in-time evaluation;
changed circumstances post-purchase may render previously suitable products
unsuitable requiring customer-initiated review and adjustment requests. Digital
channel sales may have simplified suitability assessments with automated
screening questions and algorithm-based recommendations subject to human review
for complex products. Walk-in customers requesting specific products without
full relationship context receive limited suitability assessment based on
available information and customer declarations. Regulatory changes, product
discontinuations, or bank policies may necessitate product migrations or changes
affecting existing customers handled with advance notice and alternative
options. Suitability guarantees cannot be provided as financial outcomes depend
on market conditions, customer circumstances, and macroeconomic factors beyond
Bank control despite appropriate product selection.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan responsible lending guidelines,
Consumer Protection Department directives on fair dealing, and international
principles of suitable product distribution. Suitability compliance undergoes
quarterly audits through transaction sampling, documentation review, customer
interviews, and supervisory control verification assessing adherence. The policy
is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory updates, complaint trend analysis,
mis-selling incidents, and evolving best practices in responsible product
distribution. Mystery shopping exercises assess actual sales practices testing
whether staff conduct proper needs assessment, provide balanced disclosure, and
avoid pressure tactics. Customer satisfaction surveys specifically assess
suitability perceptions asking whether products meet expectations and needs
identifying gaps between intent and perception. Staff performance evaluations
incorporate suitability compliance metrics with consequences ranging from
coaching to termination for repeated mis-selling incidents. The Bank benchmarks
suitability practices against peer institutions and international standards
adopting industry-leading practices in needs-based selling. Compensation
structure reviews ensure incentives genuinely reward suitable selling without
creating perverse incentives for short-term volume over long-term customer
satisfaction.
Category 15: Customer Service and Complaint Resolution Policies
15.1 Multi-Channel Customer Service Delivery Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive customer service delivery across multiple
touchpoints ensuring consistent, accessible, and responsive support through
channels matching customer preferences. It aims to provide seamless experiences
whether customers interact via branches, phone, digital platforms, or social
media. The policy prioritizes customer convenience while maintaining service
quality and security across all channels.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all customer service channels operated by Amanah Bank
including branch banking, 24/7 call center, internet banking support, mobile app
assistance, email support, social media engagement, video banking, and chatbot
services. It covers service availability, response time standards, staff
competency requirements, channel integration, and escalation procedures. The
policy governs routine inquiries, transaction requests, complaint handling, and
technical support across all customer segments. It applies to both direct Bank
staff and outsourced service providers operating customer-facing channels.
3. Definitions
Multi-Channel Service: Availability of customer support through diverse channels
enabling customer choice of preferred interaction method. Omnichannel
Experience: Seamless, integrated service where customer interactions across
channels are connected with shared context and history. First Call Resolution
(FCR): Percentage of customer inquiries resolved during initial contact without
transfers or callbacks. Channel Shift: Strategy of encouraging customers toward
efficient self-service digital channels for routine transactions. Service
Escalation: Transfer of complex issues to specialized teams or senior management
for resolution. Average Handling Time (AHT): Mean duration to resolve customer
inquiries including interaction time and after-call work. Customer Effort Score
(CES): Metric measuring ease of getting issues resolved from customer
perspective.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank provides comprehensive customer service across multiple channels
recognizing diverse customer preferences, digital literacy levels, and
transaction types requiring appropriate interaction methods. Branch banking
offers full-service support for complex transactions, elderly customers, and
situations requiring document verification with extended hours at select
locations serving working customers. 24/7 call center handles inquiries,
transaction requests, complaint registration, and emergency services like card
blocking providing round-the-clock telephone access with multilingual support in
Urdu and English. Internet banking and mobile app support includes in-app chat,
email tickets, and phone callbacks for technical issues, navigation assistance,
and digital transaction support. Social media monitoring on platforms including
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provides public query responses and private
message handling with 2-hour response time commitments during business hours.
Email support addresses detailed inquiries, documentation requests, and non-
urgent matters with 24-hour response commitments ensuring written communication
preferences are accommodated. Video banking enables remote face-to-face
interactions for account opening, KYC updates, and advisory services combining
branch-like personal touch with digital convenience. Chatbot services powered by
artificial intelligence handle routine inquiries like balance checks,
transaction status, FAQs, and navigation guidance with human handoff for complex
issues. Channel integration ensures customer context including previous
interactions, account information, and issue history is accessible across
channels preventing customers from repeating information. Service escalation
protocols route complex issues to specialized teams, subject matter experts, or
senior management with defined escalation criteria and turnaround time
commitments. First call resolution targets of 70% for call center and 60% for
branch inquiries drive efficiency while recognizing some issues require
investigation or follow-up beyond initial interaction. Customer feedback through
post-interaction surveys, service ratings, and regular satisfaction studies
informs continuous improvement across all service channels.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers should choose appropriate channels for their needs using self-service
digital channels for routine transactions and human-assisted channels for
complex issues optimizing efficiency. Security protocols including identity
verification questions, OTP confirmations, or account authentication must be
cooperated with patiently as these protect customer accounts from unauthorized
access. Clear communication of issues, questions, or requests with relevant
details like account numbers, transaction references, and specific concerns
enables faster, more accurate resolution. Customers should note reference
numbers from interactions for follow-up purposes enabling continuity across
multiple touchpoints or when escalating unresolved issues. Respectful, courteous
interaction with service staff regardless of channel maintains professional
environment; abusive behavior hampers resolution and may result in service
withdrawal. Customers should provide feedback through post-service surveys
honestly rating experiences and suggesting improvements helping the Bank enhance
service quality. Multiple simultaneous interactions on same issue across
different channels should be avoided as this creates confusion, duplicate
efforts, and inefficient resource utilization. Digital channel usage requires
basic device and connectivity responsibility; the Bank supports platform issues
but cannot resolve customer internet or device problems.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain adequate staffing across all channels ensuring
reasonable wait times with call center answer times within 60 seconds and branch
queues managed through token systems and staff optimization. Staff training on
product knowledge, systems operation, soft skills, and problem-solving ensures
competent service delivery with quarterly refresher programs and competency
certifications. Channel capacity planning uses historical volumes, seasonal
patterns, and growth projections to ensure sufficient resources preventing
service degradation during peak periods. Technology infrastructure supporting
customer service including telephony systems, CRM platforms, knowledge bases,
and communication tools receives continuous investment ensuring reliability and
functionality. Customer context including account details, interaction history,
and previous complaints is accessible to service staff across channels enabling
informed, personalized service without repetitive information requests. Quality
monitoring includes call recordings, branch mystery shopping, chat transcript
reviews, and email quality audits assessing staff performance against service
standards with coaching interventions. Service recovery empowers frontline staff
to resolve complaints, waive fees, or provide goodwill gestures within defined
limits enabling immediate resolution without bureaucratic escalations. The Bank
publishes channel-specific service standards including response times,
resolution timelines, and availability hours creating transparency and
accountability for service delivery. Accessibility features including hearing-
impaired support, language options, and elderly-friendly interfaces ensure
inclusive service delivery accommodating diverse customer needs. Performance
dashboards track channel metrics including volumes, wait times, resolution
rates, and customer satisfaction enabling proactive management and continuous
improvement.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Channel availability may vary with branch hours typically 9 AM to 5 PM weekdays,
call center 24/7, and digital channels always available except during
maintenance windows communicated in advance. Service scope differs by channel
with branches offering full services, call centers handling most requests, and
digital channels focused on self-service transactions with some limitations.
Complex transactions requiring physical document verification, senior management
approval, or regulatory compliance may only be feasible through branch channels
despite customer preference for remote channels. Response time commitments apply
during normal operations; system outages, natural disasters, or extraordinary
circumstances may cause temporary service degradation beyond Bank control.
Multilingual support availability varies by channel with broader language
options at branches in diverse communities compared to standardized Urdu/English
in call centers. Social media responses balance public engagement with privacy
protection; detailed account discussions occur through private channels rather
than public posts. Video banking availability may be limited based on customer
device capabilities, internet bandwidth, and appointment scheduling requiring
advance booking for guaranteed access. Outsourced service providers operate some
channels under Bank supervision; service quality may occasionally differ from
direct Bank operations though oversight ensures standards compliance.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan service quality guidelines,
consumer protection standards, and international best practices in multi-channel
banking service delivery. Service quality across channels undergoes monthly
monitoring through KPIs including response times, resolution rates, customer
satisfaction, and quality scores with performance reporting to management. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating technological advancements, channel
usage trends, customer preferences evolution, and competitive practices in
service delivery. Customer complaints regarding service quality, channel
accessibility, or staff conduct are analyzed for patterns identifying systematic
issues requiring training, process changes, or technology enhancements. Mystery
shopping and customer journey mapping assess actual service experiences across
channels testing whether standards translate into customer perceptions. Staff
training programs are updated quarterly based on service quality findings, new
product launches, system changes, and evolving customer expectations. The Bank
invests in channel innovation including AI-powered assistance, predictive
service, and proactive outreach leveraging data analytics to anticipate needs
and resolve issues before customers contact service. Benchmarking against peer
banks and global banking leaders identifies service excellence gaps driving
aspirational targets and innovation adoption.
15.2 Vulnerable Customer Support Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes specialized support mechanisms for vulnerable customers
including elderly persons, disabled individuals, low-income segments, and
financially distressed borrowers ensuring equitable access and protection. It
recognizes that uniform treatment may disadvantage customers facing special
circumstances requiring tailored approaches. The policy aims to promote
financial inclusion while preventing exploitation of vulnerability through
enhanced safeguards.
2. Scope
This policy applies to identified vulnerable customer segments including senior
citizens above 60 years, persons with physical or mental disabilities, low-
literacy customers, low-income account holders, distressed loan borrowers, and
temporarily vulnerable customers facing crises. It covers special service
provisions, communication adaptations, product modifications, complaint
prioritization, and protection measures. The policy governs staff training,
identification procedures, and support coordination. It applies across all
branches, customer service channels, and product lines ensuring consistent
vulnerability-responsive service.
3. Definitions
Vulnerable Customer: Individual facing circumstances requiring special
consideration including age, disability, financial distress, literacy
limitations, or temporary crises. Elder Customer: Person aged 60 years or above
potentially facing physical, cognitive, or digital literacy challenges requiring
patient, accessible service. Disability: Physical, sensory, cognitive, or mental
condition affecting ability to access standard banking services requiring
accommodations. Financial Distress: Temporary or permanent difficulty meeting
financial obligations requiring supportive rather than purely commercial
responses. Literacy Challenge: Limited reading, writing, or digital skills
affecting ability to understand banking products, documents, or operate digital
channels. Reasonable Accommodation: Modifications to standard procedures
enabling vulnerable customers to access services without discrimination.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank commits to inclusive banking recognizing vulnerable customers
deserve equitable access to financial services with accommodations addressing
specific challenges they face. Senior citizens receive priority service
including dedicated queues at branches, priority call routing, extended
transaction times without pressure, and patient explanations recognizing
potential physical or cognitive limitations. Customers with disabilities receive
reasonable accommodations including wheelchair accessibility at branches, audio-
visual assistance for visually or hearing-impaired customers, large-print
documents, Braille ATMs where feasible, and home banking services for mobility-
impaired customers. Low-literacy customers receive verbal explanations of
documents, simplified language in communications, pictorial guides for digital
banking, and assisted transactions without judgment or impatience. Financially
distressed borrowers receive empathetic, constructive engagement exploring
restructuring options, temporary relief measures, or financial counseling rather
than purely aggressive recovery approaches. Low-income customers access basic
banking services with reduced or waived fees, simplified account options, and
protection from unsuitable expensive products through enhanced suitability
assessment. Customers facing temporary vulnerabilities due to bereavement,
medical emergencies, or unemployment receive flexible treatment including
payment deferrals, documentation deadline extensions, or expedited processing of
legitimate requests. Staff training on vulnerability recognition, empathetic
communication, patience, and appropriate accommodations ensures consistent,
dignified treatment across all customer interactions. Complaint prioritization
gives vulnerable customer complaints enhanced urgency and senior management
visibility ensuring their concerns receive prompt, fair resolution. Protection
measures prevent exploitation of vulnerability including enhanced suitability
assessments for product sales, fraud monitoring patterns typical of elder abuse,
and cooling-off periods for significant decisions. Privacy and dignity are
maintained; vulnerability identification occurs through self-declaration,
obvious indicators, or family inputs without stigmatization or insensitive
categorization.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Vulnerable customers should self-declare their status or special needs enabling
the Bank to provide appropriate accommodations and support rather than assuming
staff will detect all vulnerabilities. Supporting documentation for disability
accommodations or senior citizen benefits including age certificates or medical
reports should be provided facilitating verification and service customization.
Family members or trusted representatives can be designated to assist with
banking particularly for customers with cognitive limitations or severe
disabilities ensuring supported rather than independent decision-making where
appropriate. Customers should communicate specific needs clearly whether
requiring large-print statements, sign language interpretation, home visits, or
extended service times enabling staff to respond effectively. Reasonable
cooperation with security procedures is necessary; vulnerability doesn't exempt
customers from identity verification or transaction authorization requirements
protecting account security. Vulnerability status changes including recovery
from temporary distress or changed capabilities should be communicated enabling
service adjustments aligned with current circumstances. Customers should utilize
available support resources including financial counseling, customer service
assistance, or family consultation for significant financial decisions
preventing impulsive or unsuitable choices. Vulnerability accommodations are
genuine service enhancements not opportunities for preferential treatment in
policy compliance; regulatory requirements and policy adherence apply
universally.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall train all customer-facing staff on vulnerability recognition,
sensitive communication, patience, and accommodation provision ensuring
dignified service delivery. Branch infrastructure includes wheelchair ramps,
accessible restrooms, comfortable seating areas, and clear signage supporting
physical accessibility for disabled and elderly customers. Technology
accommodations include screen readers for visually impaired, large-font options
in apps, voice-assisted banking, and simplified interfaces for low-literacy
users. Home banking services enable mobility-impaired or extremely elderly
customers to conduct transactions through scheduled staff visits with proper
security protocols and documentation. Sign language interpretation, multilingual
support, and communication aids assist customers with hearing, speech, or
language barriers ensuring effective interaction. Distressed borrower support
programs include financial counseling, restructuring options, temporary payment
deferrals, and connection to social services when appropriate providing holistic
assistance beyond pure collections. Priority handling systems identify
vulnerable customers in queues, call routing, and complaint management ensuring
they receive timely attention without excessive waiting. The Bank monitors
vulnerable customer accounts for unusual activity patterns potentially
indicating exploitation, fraud, or undue influence by others triggering welfare
checks. Product design incorporates accessibility considerations including
simplified terms, affordable pricing, and protection features relevant to
vulnerable segments. The Bank collaborates with disability organizations, elder
care services, and financial counseling agencies ensuring awareness of best
practices and available community resources for customer support. Feedback
mechanisms specifically capture vulnerable customer experiences identifying
service gaps, accommodation deficiencies, or staff insensitivity requiring
corrective action.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Vulnerability doesn't override security requirements; identity verification,
transaction authorization, and fraud prevention protocols apply universally
protecting all customers including vulnerable ones. Some accommodations face
practical limitations including Braille ATMs availability constrained by cost-
benefit considerations, requiring pragmatic alternatives like audio guidance or
assisted service. Home banking services for mobility-impaired customers may have
geographic limitations, minimum transaction thresholds, or appointment
scheduling requirements managing operational feasibility. Priority service for
vulnerable customers doesn't guarantee immediate service during extreme peak
periods; reasonable priority within operational constraints applies.
Vulnerability support focuses on accessibility and fair treatment; it cannot
provide financial concessions violating banking regulations or creating unfair
advantages over other customers. Self-declaration of vulnerability is generally
accepted; however, the Bank may request verification for significant
accommodations preventing abuse of vulnerability provisions. Vulnerability
identification by staff is based on observable indicators and customer
communication; the Bank cannot identify all vulnerable situations requiring
customer cooperation in disclosure. Financial distress support explores
rehabilitation options but cannot guarantee loan waivers or forgiveness;
commercial sustainability and fairness to depositors require balanced
approaches.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan financial inclusion directives,
disability rights legislation, elder protection principles, and international
accessibility standards. Vulnerable customer service provisions undergo annual
audits assessing accommodation availability, staff competency, and vulnerable
customer satisfaction. The policy is reviewed annually incorporating disability
advocacy feedback, elder service best practices, and evolving understanding of
vulnerability dimensions. Vulnerable customer complaint analysis identifies
service gaps, insensitive treatment, or accommodation deficiencies requiring
systemic improvements. Staff training on vulnerability support is mandatory
annually with scenario-based learning covering diverse vulnerability types and
appropriate responses. The Bank collaborates with disability organizations
conducting accessibility audits of branches and digital channels with
implementation of recommended improvements. Mystery shopping includes vulnerable
customer scenario testing assessing whether staff provide patient, accommodating
service aligned with policy commitments. Performance metrics track vulnerable
customer satisfaction, accommodation provision rates, and complaint resolution
ensuring accountability for inclusive service delivery.
Category 16: Digital and Accessibility Policies
16.1 Digital Banking Services and Innovation Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes framework for developing, launching, and managing
digital banking services ensuring innovation serves customer convenience while
maintaining security, reliability, and regulatory compliance. It aims to
position Amanah Bank as a digitally progressive institution meeting evolving
customer expectations. The policy balances rapid innovation with prudent risk
management and inclusive design.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all digital banking initiatives including internet
banking platforms, mobile banking applications, USSD banking, API-based
services, chatbots, digital account opening, blockchain experiments, and
emerging technology adoption. It covers innovation governance, customer testing,
security requirements, accessibility standards, and performance monitoring. The
policy governs digital service development, launch approvals, post-launch
support, and periodic enhancement. It applies to both customer-facing digital
services and internal digital processes improving customer experiences
indirectly.
3. Definitions
Digital Banking: Delivery of banking services through electronic channels
including internet, mobile apps, and automated systems without physical branch
interaction. Innovation: Development or adoption of new technologies, processes,
or service models enhancing customer value or operational efficiency. User
Experience (UX): Overall experience customers have using digital services
including ease, intuitiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Application
Programming Interface (API): Technical interface enabling third-party
applications to integrate with Bank systems securely. Minimum Viable Product
(MVP): Initial version of digital service with core features enabling customer
testing and feedback before full development. Digital Divide: Gap between
customers with digital access and skills versus those lacking technology or
literacy to use digital services. Fintech Partnership: Collaboration with
financial technology companies leveraging their innovations while maintaining
Bank's customer relationships and regulatory compliance.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank embraces digital innovation as strategic priority investing in
technology enhancing customer convenience, operational efficiency, and
competitive positioning in evolving banking landscape. Digital service
development follows customer-centric design thinking involving customer
research, prototype testing, iterative development, and post-launch optimization
ensuring solutions address genuine customer needs. Security-by-design principles
embed cybersecurity, data protection, and fraud prevention in digital services
from conception rather than retrofitting security after development.
Accessibility standards ensure digital services accommodate diverse customers
including elderly users, disabled persons, and those with limited digital
literacy through inclusive design and alternative channels. Mobile-first
strategy prioritizes smartphone-based banking recognizing mobile penetration
exceeds desktop internet usage particularly in emerging customer segments.
Innovation governance includes cross-functional committees evaluating digital
initiatives for business value, risk profile, regulatory compliance, and
alignment with strategic priorities before approval. Pilot testing with customer
groups validates digital services before full launch gathering feedback,
identifying bugs, and refining features minimizing post-launch issues.
Performance monitoring tracks digital service adoption, usage patterns, customer
satisfaction, and technical performance enabling data-driven optimization and
issue resolution. Open banking principles through secure APIs enable integration
with fintech partners, aggregation services, and third-party apps expanding
service ecosystem while maintaining security. Digital channel shift strategies
encourage customer migration from branches to self-service channels for routine
transactions through education, incentives, and superior digital experiences
optimizing resource allocation. The Bank maintains hybrid model supporting
customers preferring traditional channels while enhancing digital options
recognizing transition takes time and universal digital adoption remains
aspirational.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers adopting digital banking must invest time learning platform
functionality through tutorials, demos, and practice transactions building
confidence and competence. Device security including operating system updates,
antivirus software, strong passwords, and avoiding rooted/jailbroken devices is
customer responsibility protecting their digital banking access. Customers
should report digital service bugs, usability issues, or improvement suggestions
through feedback channels helping the Bank enhance platform quality. Digital
self-service usage for routine transactions frees branch staff for complex
services; customers should embrace appropriate channel usage optimizing
efficiency. Customers uncomfortable with digital banking should access available
training including branch demonstrations, video tutorials, or dedicated
helplines rather than avoiding beneficial services due to intimidation. Digital
literacy development is encouraged through Bank-provided resources, community
classes, or family assistance recognizing some customers need support beyond
intuitive design. Customers should review digital transaction confirmations,
alerts, and statements regularly detecting errors or fraud promptly enabling
swift resolution. Digital channel availability doesn't eliminate customer
responsibility for transaction accuracy; input errors remain customer
responsibility regardless of channel used.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall invest substantially in digital infrastructure, platforms, and
talent ensuring technical capabilities match strategic digital ambitions and
customer expectations. User experience design involves actual customers through
focus groups, usability testing, and beta programs ensuring interfaces are
intuitive, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. Digital services undergo
rigorous security testing including penetration testing, vulnerability
assessments, and compliance audits before launch ensuring customer data and
transaction security. The Bank provides comprehensive digital banking education
through in-app tutorials, video guides, branch demonstrations, and dedicated
helplines easing customer transition to digital channels. Performance monitoring
includes uptime tracking, transaction success rates, loading speeds, and error
rates with immediate escalation for service degradation. Customer feedback
through ratings, reviews, support contacts, and behavioral analytics informs
continuous enhancement ensuring digital services evolve with needs and
expectations. The Bank maintains channel redundancy ensuring branch and phone
banking remain available for customers unable or unwilling to use digital
services preventing digital exclusion. Innovation pipeline balances emerging
technology experimentation with stable core platform maintenance ensuring
reliability doesn't suffer in pursuit of innovation. Fintech partnerships
undergo due diligence assessing technical competency, security standards,
financial stability, and regulatory compliance before integration approval. The
Bank communicates digital service updates, new features, and maintenance
schedules proactively through multiple channels ensuring customers stay informed
and can plan usage.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Digital services cannot replicate every branch service; complex transactions,
document submissions, or exceptions may still require physical branch visits
despite digital advancements. Technology glitches, network outages, or
cyberattacks may occasionally disrupt digital services; the Bank maintains
business continuity through alternative channels and rapid incident response.
Digital innovation experiments may have limited initial availability,
functionality constraints, or pilot participant restrictions before broader
rollout. Customer internet connectivity, device capabilities, and digital
literacy affect digital service experiences; the Bank optimizes platforms but
cannot control customer-side technology limitations. Digital channel shift
incentives including lower fees or enhanced features for digital transactions
reflect genuine cost differences and encourage efficient channel usage without
penalizing non-digital users excessively. Third-party app integrations through
open banking APIs create some dependence on external service provider
reliability and security beyond direct Bank control. Emerging technologies
including blockchain or artificial intelligence are experimental; the Bank makes
no guarantees regarding timing or ultimate adoption as commercial viability and
regulatory clarity evolve. Digital preference data collected through usage
analytics informs personalization but also creates data privacy considerations
managed through strict consent and protection protocols.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan digital banking regulations,
cybersecurity guidelines, Electronic Transactions Ordinance, and international
standards for digital financial services. Digital service launches undergo
regulatory approval where required ensuring compliance with licensing, security,
and consumer protection regulations before customer availability. The policy is
reviewed semi-annually incorporating technological developments, regulatory
updates, customer feedback, and competitive landscape changes. Digital banking
metrics including adoption rates, transaction volumes, customer satisfaction,
and technical performance are monitored through executive dashboards driving
accountability. Customer complaints regarding digital services are prioritized
with rapid resolution, root cause analysis, and systemic fixes preventing
recurrence. Staff training on digital banking support, troubleshooting, customer
education, and escalation procedures ensures competent assistance across all
service channels. The Bank participates in banking technology forums, fintech
ecosystems, and regulatory consultations on digital banking contributing to
industry standards and regulatory development. Investment in digital innovation
balances short-term enhancements with long-term transformation ensuring
sustainable competitive positioning in digital banking landscape.
Category 17: Marketing and Communication Policies
17.1 Marketing Communications and Advertising Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes ethical standards for marketing communications ensuring
advertisements, promotions, and customer outreach are truthful, transparent, and
respectful. It prevents misleading marketing practices that exploit customer
trust or create unrealistic expectations. The policy aims to build brand
reputation through honest, customer-centric communications compliant with
regulations and social norms.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all marketing activities including print advertisements,
television commercials, radio spots, digital marketing, social media content,
SMS campaigns, email marketing, outdoor advertising, and promotional materials
across all products and services offered by Amanah Bank. It covers content
development, approval processes, disclosure requirements, consent management,
and compliance verification. The policy governs internal marketing teams,
external advertising agencies, brand ambassadors, and third-party marketers
acting on the Bank's behalf. It applies to both mass marketing campaigns and
personalized direct marketing communications.
3. Definitions
Marketing Communication: Any message from the Bank promoting products, services,
or brand designed to influence customer perceptions or decisions. Advertisement:
Paid promotional content in media channels including print, broadcast, digital,
or outdoor platforms. Direct Marketing: Personalized communications to specific
customers including SMS, email, telemarketing, or direct mail. Disclosure:
Transparent communication of material terms, conditions, risks, or limitations
associated with promoted products. Opt-In Consent: Customer agreement to receive
marketing communications providing permission for future outreach. Greenwashing:
Misleading environmental claims creating false impression of sustainability or
social responsibility. Testimonial: Customer or celebrity endorsement of Bank
products requiring genuine experiences and appropriate disclosures.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank conducts marketing with integrity ensuring all communications are
truthful, substantiated, and not misleading through omission or exaggeration
protecting customer trust. Product benefits highlighted in marketing must be
accurate and achievable; exaggerated claims, impossible promises, or selective
disclosure of favorable attributes while hiding limitations are prohibited.
Interest rates, fees, eligibility criteria, and material terms prominently
featured in advertising are accurate and current; fine print cannot contradict
or substantially limit headline claims. Comparative advertising against
competitors must be factual, verifiable, and fair avoiding disparagement,
misrepresentation, or unfair comparisons cherry-picking favorable dimensions.
Risk disclosures accompany marketing for products with potential downsides
including variable rates, market risks, penalties, or long-term commitments
ensuring balanced information. Marketing targeting vulnerable populations
including children, elderly persons, or low-income segments receives enhanced
scrutiny ensuring protection from exploitation and unsuitable product promotion.
Direct marketing to customers requires prior opt-in consent; unsolicited
marketing to those who haven't consented or have opted out violates customer
preferences and regulations. Marketing materials undergo multi-level approval
including product, legal, compliance, and marketing teams ensuring accuracy,
regulatory compliance, and alignment with brand values before release. Celebrity
or customer testimonials must reflect genuine experiences, cannot make atypical
claims without disclosure, and require written consent from individuals
featured. Marketing campaigns track customer response, complaints, and
regulatory feedback enabling rapid correction if unintended misleading
impressions emerge post-launch.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers should read marketing materials critically assessing claims against
their needs and seeking detailed information beyond promotional highlights
before decisions. Promotional offers have specific terms, conditions,
eligibility criteria, and time limitations; customers should verify these
details rather than assuming universal applicability. Consent to marketing
communications can be withdrawn anytime through opt-out mechanisms provided in
messages; customers should actively manage communication preferences. Customers
encountering misleading advertising should report concerns through complaint
channels enabling investigation and corrective action protecting other
customers. Marketing creates awareness but shouldn't replace comprehensive due
diligence; customers should review terms and conditions, compare alternatives,
and assess suitability before product purchases. Promotional pricing, waived
fees, or special rates typically have time limitations or eligibility
conditions; customers should understand when regular pricing resumes or what
triggers apply. Customers should protect themselves from phishing or fraud
attempts mimicking Bank marketing by verifying message authenticity through
official channels before responding.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall establish marketing approval workflows requiring sign-off from
product owners verifying claim accuracy, legal teams confirming regulatory
compliance, and senior management ensuring brand alignment. Marketing content
undergoes fact-checking verifying all statistics, product features, pricing, and
claims against current product terms and competitive information. Disclosure
hierarchies ensure material information appears prominently in marketing not
relegated to fine print, footnotes, or linked documents requiring proactive
customer effort to discover. The Bank maintains current marketing material
repository with version control ensuring outdated materials with incorrect
information are withdrawn from circulation. Customer complaints regarding
misleading marketing are investigated within 3 business days with immediate
corrective action including campaign withdrawal, customer communication, and
internal accountability. Marketing effectiveness metrics balance response rates
with quality indicators including suitability of resulting sales, customer
satisfaction, and complaint rates preventing purely volume-driven evaluation.
The Bank monitors competitor advertising and industry practices ensuring its
marketing maintains competitive truth standards without racing to bottom in
exaggeration. Marketing budgets allocate resources to customer education and
financial literacy alongside promotional campaigns demonstrating social
responsibility beyond commercial interests. Agency contracts include clauses
holding agencies accountable for content accuracy, regulatory compliance, and
brand standard adherence with consequences for violations. The Bank publishes
marketing guidelines on its website transparently communicating ethical
standards and inviting customer feedback on advertising practices.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Promotional offers targeting new customers or specific segments may appear
preferential; differential pricing based on objective criteria like relationship
value or risk profile is permissible with transparent explanation. Limited-time
offers create urgency; while legitimate, artificial urgency through deceptive
scarcity tactics or false deadlines is prohibited. Aspirational marketing using
imagery, emotions, or lifestyle associations is acceptable provided core claims
about products remain factual and substantiated. Humor, creativity, or
attention-grabbing techniques in marketing are encouraged provided they don't
mislead through implication or create false impressions about product
attributes. Marketing to existing customers through relationship channels may
reference account-specific information; this personalization uses existing data
with consent rather than constituting privacy violation. Regional marketing
variations reflect local languages, cultural nuances, or market conditions;
consistency in core messages and claims is maintained across regions. Digital
marketing including search ads, social media, and online display follow
platform-specific rules and formats; space constraints require adaptation while
maintaining substantive accuracy. Regulatory pre-approval is sought for
marketing of new products, complex instruments, or materials making
medical/legal claims ensuring compliance before customer exposure.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with State Bank of Pakistan advertising guidelines,
Consumer Protection Department directives, Advertisement Standards Council
codes, and international marketing ethics principles. Marketing materials
undergo compliance reviews before launch and post-launch monitoring ensures
actual customer communications align with approved content. The policy is
reviewed annually incorporating regulatory updates, complaint learnings,
industry standard evolution, and brand strategy changes. Customer complaints
regarding marketing are analyzed quarterly identifying patterns suggesting
systematic misleading elements requiring campaign modification or withdrawal.
Mystery shopping assesses whether branch staff explanations align with marketing
promises testing consistency between advertising and actual service delivery.
Staff training on marketing ethics, claim substantiation, disclosure
requirements, and handling customer queries about promotions ensures
organizational alignment with policy. The Bank participates in advertising self-
regulatory bodies contributing to industry standards development and subjecting
its marketing to independent ethical review. Marketing campaign post-mortems
evaluate not just commercial success but also ethical performance, customer
feedback, and regulatory interactions informing future campaign development.
Category 18: Customer Education and Awareness Policies
18.1 Financial Literacy and Customer Education Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes Amanah Bank's commitment to customer financial literacy
enhancing understanding of banking products, financial planning, digital safety,
and rights and responsibilities. It recognizes that educated customers make
better financial decisions benefiting themselves and creating sustainable
banking relationships. The policy aims to position the Bank as a trusted
financial education resource beyond its commercial role.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all financial education initiatives including branch
workshops, digital content, school programs, community outreach, financial
counseling, product tutorials, and awareness campaigns conducted by Amanah Bank.
It covers topics including banking basics, budgeting, savings, credit
management, investment understanding, fraud prevention, digital banking safety,
and customer rights. The policy governs content development, delivery methods,
target audience selection, and impact measurement. It applies to education
provided directly by Bank staff, through partnerships with educational
institutions, and via digital platforms reaching broad audiences.
3. Definitions
Financial Literacy: Knowledge and skills to make informed, effective decisions
regarding financial resources and banking products. Customer Education:
Structured learning initiatives helping customers understand banking operations,
products, rights, and financial management. Financial Inclusion: Efforts
ensuring all population segments including underserved communities access
financial services and education. Digital Financial Literacy: Specific knowledge
for safely and effectively using digital banking channels, apps, and online
financial services. **Financial CounselRetrySMContinue3. Definitions (continued)
Financial Counseling: Personalized guidance helping distressed customers manage
debt, restructure obligations, or navigate financial difficulties. Awareness
Campaign: Mass communication initiative educating customers about specific risks
like fraud, rights like complaint mechanisms, or opportunities like new
services.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank commits to financial literacy as corporate social responsibility and
business strategy recognizing educated customers benefit from better financial
outcomes and sustainable banking relationships. Banking basics education covers
account types, transaction methods, interest calculations, fee structures, and
digital banking usage through branch workshops, video tutorials, and
informational brochures helping customers navigate services confidently.
Budgeting and savings guidance teaches income-expense management, emergency fund
building, goal-based saving, and compound interest benefits encouraging
financial discipline and long-term wealth building particularly for young
customers and low-income segments. Credit management education explains loan
products, interest calculations, credit scores, repayment discipline, and debt
trap avoidance empowering borrowers to use credit responsibly without over-
extension. Investment literacy initiatives demystify mutual funds, government
securities, stock market basics, risk-return relationships, and diversification
principles enabling informed investment decisions beyond traditional deposits.
Fraud prevention awareness campaigns educate about phishing, vishing, card
skimming, identity theft, and social engineering tactics providing practical
protection tips and reporting mechanisms reducing customer victimization.
Digital banking tutorials through in-app guides, video demonstrations, and
hands-on branch sessions teach platform navigation, security practices, and
troubleshooting building confidence in digital adoption especially among elderly
and technology-hesitant customers. Rights and responsibilities education informs
customers about grievance mechanisms, regulatory protections, Banking Mohtasib,
product suitability rights, and their obligations regarding accurate information
and timely payments creating informed, empowered consumers. School and college
partnerships deliver financial literacy modules to students teaching early money
management, banking relationships, career financial planning, and
entrepreneurship basics building lifetime financial competency. Community
outreach targets underserved areas, women's groups, small businesses, and rural
populations addressing specific financial challenges, access barriers, and
literacy gaps advancing financial inclusion goals. Financial counseling for
distressed customers provides empathetic, constructive guidance on debt
management, restructuring options, budgeting assistance, and sometimes referrals
to social services going beyond commercial recovery to genuine customer welfare.
Content quality ensures accuracy, simplicity, cultural sensitivity, and
practical applicability with periodic expert review maintaining educational
credibility and usefulness.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers should actively engage with available financial education resources
including attending workshops, watching tutorials, reading materials, and asking
questions to enhance their financial literacy. Learning must translate to
practice; customers should apply budgeting principles, security practices, and
informed decision-making taught through education programs in their actual
financial management. Customers participating in workshops or counseling
sessions should provide honest financial information enabling personalized,
relevant guidance rather than generic advice with limited applicability.
Feedback on education programs regarding content clarity, relevance, delivery
effectiveness, and suggested topics helps the Bank improve educational offerings
continually. Customers should share financial literacy knowledge with family
members, particularly teaching children money management and protecting elderly
relatives from financial fraud creating multiplier effects. Financial education
provides knowledge tools but cannot guarantee financial success; customers
remain responsible for their financial decisions, discipline, and outcomes
regardless of education received. Customers should verify information from
multiple sources for major financial decisions; while Bank education is
valuable, consulting independent financial advisors for complex situations is
prudent. Participation in education programs doesn't create obligations to
purchase Bank products; customers should view education as separate from sales
maintaining healthy skepticism in commercial contexts.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall develop comprehensive financial literacy curriculum covering
essential topics with content refreshed annually incorporating new products,
emerging risks, and regulatory changes. Educational content uses clear, simple
language avoiding jargon, with multilingual options (Urdu, English, regional
languages) ensuring accessibility across diverse populations. Delivery methods
accommodate different learning preferences including in-person workshops for
interactive learners, video content for visual learners, written guides for
readers, and one-on-one counseling for personalized needs. Branch staff receive
training as financial educators capable of explaining products clearly,
answering questions patiently, and conducting basic financial literacy sessions
as community ambassadors. The Bank collaborates with schools, colleges, NGOs,
and community organizations reaching audiences beyond existing customers
advancing financial literacy as public good not just customer service. Digital
platforms including website, mobile app, YouTube channel, and social media
distribute educational content broadly with search optimization and social
sharing enabling viral reach. Impact measurement through pre-post surveys,
knowledge tests, behavior change tracking, and long-term customer financial
health indicators assesses education effectiveness informing program refinement.
The Bank allocates dedicated budget to financial literacy separate from
marketing budgets demonstrating genuine commitment beyond using education as
product promotion vehicle. Financial counselors undergo specialized training in
debt management, empathetic communication, and social service resources
providing professional, compassionate support to distressed customers.
Educational initiatives maintain neutrality providing balanced information about
banking generally not just Amanah Bank specifically and covering competitor
products where helpful for informed decisions. Annual financial literacy reports
document program reach, impact, success stories, and plans demonstrating
transparency and accountability in education commitments.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Financial education provides general guidance not personalized financial advice;
customers with complex situations should consult certified financial planners or
advisors for tailored recommendations. Education programs are complementary
services not contractual obligations; program availability, frequency, or topics
may change based on resources, demand, or strategic priorities. Financial
literacy content is educational not predictive; economic conditions, market
performance, or individual circumstances affect outcomes beyond what education
can control. Bank staff conducting education are trained presenters not
certified financial advisors; their role is explaining products and concepts not
providing investment or legal advice. Educational materials may reference Amanah
Bank products as examples; this isn't sales pressure but practical context
requiring customer discernment separating education from promotion. Financial
counseling explores options within Bank's products and policies; customers may
need to consider alternatives including other banks, debt consolidation
companies, or bankruptcy counsel for comprehensive solutions. Participation in
education programs doesn't entitle customers to fee waivers, preferential rates,
or service exceptions; commercial terms remain separate from educational
benefits. Educational content reflects current knowledge and regulations;
rapidly evolving areas like fintech, regulations, or tax laws may have
information lags before educational materials update.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan financial inclusion goals,
Consumer Protection Department literacy initiatives, and international
principles of customer financial capability building. Educational content
undergoes periodic expert review by financial planning professionals, consumer
advocates, and regulatory specialists ensuring accuracy and appropriateness. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating educational impact data, customer
feedback, regulatory priorities, and emerging financial literacy needs.
Financial literacy program metrics including reach, participation, knowledge
improvement, and behavior change are reported quarterly to senior management and
Board committees. Customer satisfaction surveys assess perceived value, content
quality, delivery effectiveness, and topics of interest informing program
development and resource allocation. Staff training on financial education
delivery, adult learning principles, and community engagement ensures quality,
consistency, and professionalism in education initiatives. The Bank benchmarks
its financial literacy efforts against peer institutions and international best
practices aspiring to leadership in banking sector education initiatives.
Partnerships with educational institutions, consumer organizations, and
government financial inclusion programs are pursued amplifying impact through
collaboration and resource sharing.
Category 19: Financial Inclusion and Accessibility Policies
19.1 Financial Inclusion and Underserved Segment Banking Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes Amanah Bank's commitment to financial inclusion ensuring
banking services reach underserved populations including low-income individuals,
rural communities, women, youth, and persons with disabilities. It recognizes
that universal financial access is both social responsibility and business
opportunity. The policy balances commercial sustainability with inclusive
banking ensuring profitability doesn't exclude deserving segments.
2. Scope
This policy applies to products, services, and delivery channels specifically
designed or adapted for financial inclusion including basic banking accounts,
microfinance, agent banking, mobile banking, simplified KYC, and targeted credit
programs. It covers rural branch expansion, women-focused initiatives, youth
banking, accessibility features, and pricing concessions for inclusion segments.
The policy governs product design, eligibility criteria, documentation
requirements, and performance measurement. It applies across all geographies
with emphasis on underserved areas lacking banking penetration.
3. Definitions
Financial Inclusion: Ensuring all individuals and businesses have access to
useful, affordable financial products and services delivered responsibly and
sustainably. Underserved Segment: Population groups with limited access to
formal banking including rural residents, low-income individuals, women, youth,
persons with disabilities, and informal sector workers. Basic Banking Account:
No-frills account with minimal documentation, zero or low fees, and essential
services enabling entry into formal banking. Agent Banking: Licensed third-party
agents operating as Bank touchpoints in areas lacking branches extending reach
cost-effectively. Microfinance: Small loans to low-income borrowers or micro-
enterprises typically lacking collateral or formal credit history. Simplified
KYC: Relaxed documentation requirements for low-risk, low-value accounts
balancing inclusion with compliance. Financial Literacy: Critical companion to
access ensuring customers understand and effectively use financial services.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank embraces financial inclusion as strategic priority and social
responsibility committing resources, innovation, and leadership to banking the
unbanked and underbanked. Basic banking accounts with zero minimum balance, no
monthly fees, free debit cards, and limited free transactions provide affordable
entry points for low-income customers and first-time bankers previously excluded
by minimum balance requirements. Rural branch expansion guided by strategic
planning targets underserved districts ensuring physical banking presence in
areas lacking financial infrastructure with appropriate staffing, security, and
service levels. Agent banking through partnerships with retailers, post offices,
and community enterprises extends banking touchpoints to remote villages and
urban slums where traditional branches aren't viable economically. Mobile
banking and USSD services enable basic transactions through simple phones
without internet requirements recognizing smartphone penetration limitations in
low-income and rural segments. Women-focused banking includes women-only
branches or service windows in conservative communities, women entrepreneurs
loan programs, and female relationship managers addressing cultural barriers to
women's banking participation. Youth banking introduces school and college
students to banking through simplified accounts, financial literacy programs,
and youth-appropriate services building lifetime banking relationships from
early age. Microfinance and small business loans with flexible collateral
requirements, group lending models, and simplified applications provide credit
access to informal sector workers and micro-entrepreneurs excluded from
traditional lending. Persons with disabilities receive accessibility
accommodations including wheelchair access, Braille materials, sign language
interpretation, and home banking services ensuring equitable access. Simplified
KYC procedures for accounts with low balances and transaction limits reduce
documentation barriers for populations lacking conventional identity or address
proofs within regulatory guidelines. Pricing concessions including fee waivers,
lower interest rates, or preferential terms for inclusion segments balance
social objectives with commercial sustainability through cross-subsidization
from profitable segments. Financial literacy initiatives specifically target
inclusion segments teaching basic banking, digital usage, fraud prevention, and
financial management building capability alongside access. Impact measurement
tracks inclusion metrics including accounts opened in rural areas, women account
holders, low-balance accounts, microfinance disbursed, and agent banking
transactions demonstrating commitment and accountability.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Inclusion segment customers must provide accurate available documentation for
account opening cooperating with bank's efforts to balance inclusion with
regulatory compliance. Low-balance accounts, while fee-free, require customers
to maintain account activity and use services appropriately avoiding dormancy or
misuse that creates operational costs without benefits. Financial literacy
resources provided by the Bank should be utilized by inclusion customers
building capability to manage accounts, avoid fraud, and use services
effectively maximizing inclusion benefits. Women customers in conservative
settings should communicate cultural considerations enabling the Bank to provide
appropriate accommodations like female staff or private service areas. Youth
account holders and students should use accounts for intended purposes avoiding
misuse for adult transactions or exploiting simplified requirements.
Microfinance borrowers must honor repayment commitments even without traditional
collateral as group lending and character-based lending rely on trust and
community accountability. Agent banking customers should verify agent
authorization through displayed certificates and report any suspicious agent
behavior protecting service integrity. Inclusion benefits including fee waivers
or preferential rates are designed for eligible segments; customers should not
exploit inclusion products if they don't genuinely belong to target segments.
Customers should graduate to regular banking products when their financial
status improves ensuring inclusion products serve those truly needing them
rather than becoming permanently concessional alternatives.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall allocate capital, human resources, and management attention to
inclusion initiatives ensuring they receive adequate support not just token
efforts or box-checking exercises. Product design for inclusion balances
simplicity, affordability, and functionality avoiding over-simplification that
restricts utility or patronizes users while ensuring accessibility for target
segments. Staff in rural branches, agent banking operations, and inclusion-
focused roles receive specialized training on serving diverse customers,
cultural sensitivity, and patient service for first-time bankers. The Bank
invests in appropriate technology enabling cost-effective service delivery
through mobile platforms, agent networks, and biometric authentication reducing
per-transaction costs making small accounts viable. Risk management adapts to
inclusion contexts using alternative credit assessment methods like psychometric
testing, social guarantees, or transaction behavior analysis where traditional
credit scores are absent. The Bank collaborates with government programs, NGOs,
self-help groups, and community organizations leveraging existing trust networks
and social infrastructure accelerating inclusion. Performance incentives for
branches and staff include inclusion metrics alongside profitability ensuring
field teams are motivated to pursue inclusion goals not just chase high-value
customers. Monitoring systems track inclusion account usage, dormancy, fraud
patterns, and customer satisfaction enabling early intervention when issues
arise and continuous improvement in service delivery. The Bank publicly reports
inclusion progress through annual disclosures, regulatory submissions, and
sustainability reports demonstrating transparency and accountability in social
commitments. The Bank advocates for supportive policies including simplified
regulations, financial infrastructure investments, and digital literacy programs
contributing to national financial inclusion ecosystem beyond its institutional
efforts.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Financial inclusion prioritizes access but cannot guarantee credit approval;
loan decisions remain risk-based with many inclusion customers facing rejections
due to legitimate creditworthiness concerns. Fee waivers and concessions for
inclusion accounts apply to target segments; the Bank reserves rights to verify
eligibility and withdraw concessions if accounts are misused or customers are
ineligible. Rural branch presence depends on security assessments, viable
population density, and operational feasibility; the Bank strives for broad
coverage but cannot serve every remote village with physical branches. Agent
banking depends on agent performance, security, and regulatory compliance;
poorly performing or non-compliant agents may be terminated affecting local
service availability temporarily until replacement. Simplified KYC applies
within regulatory limits typically accounts below specified thresholds; higher-
value relationships require standard KYC regardless of customer segment.
Inclusion products may have feature limitations like transaction caps,
restricted payment types, or limited channel access balancing affordability with
risk management. Technology-based inclusion services require customer access to
mobile phones and basic digital literacy; the Bank provides training but cannot
overcome complete technology absence in some populations. Cross-subsidization
supporting inclusion pricing depends on profitable segment performance; severe
financial stress could necessitate inclusion program modifications ensuring
institutional sustainability.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy aligns with State Bank of Pakistan financial inclusion strategy,
national financial inclusion framework, priority sector lending targets, and
international inclusive finance principles. Inclusion program performance
undergoes quarterly reviews assessing reach, usage, viability, and social impact
with regular reporting to Board committees and regulatory authorities. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory changes, technology
evolution, competitive practices, and learnings from inclusion initiatives.
Inclusion metrics including accounts opened, loan disbursements, rural
penetration, women participation, and agent network size are tracked monthly
driving accountability. Customer satisfaction surveys specifically target
inclusion customers assessing service quality, discrimination perception,
accessibility adequacy, and unmet needs informing improvements. Staff training
on inclusion banking, cultural sensitivity, rural operations, and serving
diverse populations is mandatory annually reinforcing organizational inclusion
commitment. The Bank participates in financial inclusion forums, industry
collaborations, and policy dialogues contributing expertise and learning from
broader inclusion ecosystem. Impact assessments using third-party evaluators
periodically measure social outcomes including poverty reduction, women
empowerment, and financial resilience attributable to Bank's inclusion efforts
demonstrating genuine impact beyond access statistics.
Category 20: Insurance and Investment Service Policies
20.1 Bancassurance and Insurance Distribution Policy
1. Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for distributing insurance products through
Amanah Bank's branch network as corporate agent ensuring suitable product
recommendations, transparent pricing, and compliant distribution practices. It
protects customer interests in insurance purchases while enabling the Bank to
diversify revenue through insurance commissions. The policy balances commercial
incentives with suitability obligations recognizing insurance is protection not
purely investment.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all insurance product distribution activities including
life insurance, health insurance, general insurance, credit life insurance, and
investment-linked insurance offered through Amanah Bank branches and digital
channels. It covers product selection, advisor training, needs assessment,
disclosure requirements, claim support, and commission structures. The policy
governs relationships with insurance partners, product governance, compliance
monitoring, and customer complaint handling. It applies to all staff involved in
insurance distribution whether full-time insurance specialists or branch staff
with cross-selling responsibilities.
3. Definitions
Bancassurance: Distribution of insurance products through bank branches
leveraging customer relationships and distribution networks. Corporate Agent:
Bank acting as licensed agent for insurance companies distributing their
products to customers. Insurance Advisor: Bank staff certified and licensed to
sell insurance products after completing regulatory training and examinations.
Needs Assessment: Process of understanding customer's protection needs, risk
profile, and financial capacity before insurance recommendation. Credit Life
Insurance: Insurance covering loan repayment upon borrower's death or disability
protecting families and Bank. Investment-Linked Insurance: Insurance policies
combining protection with investment components where returns vary with
underlying fund performance. Policy Illustration: Document showing premium,
benefits, maturity values, and assumptions helping customers understand
insurance products. Surrender Value: Amount payable if insurance policy is
terminated before maturity typically less than premiums paid especially in early
years.
4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank distributes insurance products as corporate agent partnering with
reputable insurance companies after due diligence on their financial strength,
product quality, and claim settlement reputation ensuring customer interests.
Only insurance advisors holding valid regulatory licenses and certifications
sell insurance products; untrained staff provide basic information directing
customers to licensed advisors for actual sales. Comprehensive needs assessment
precedes insurance recommendations exploring customer's existing coverage,
dependents, liabilities, financial goals, and risk tolerance ensuring products
address genuine protection needs. Product disclosure includes policy
illustrations showing realistic return scenarios, fee structures, premium
allocation, surrender values, and exclusions enabling informed purchase
decisions beyond marketing highlights. Insurance is presented as protection tool
not guaranteed investment; return projections for investment-linked products
show multiple scenarios including poor market performance managing expectations
honestly. Credit life insurance for loan customers is optional despite strong
recommendations; customers can decline understanding they and families bear full
loan obligation upon death or disability. Commission structures are disclosed to
customers transparently explaining that Bank earns compensation from insurance
companies enabling customers to assess potential conflict of interest in
recommendations. High surrender charges in early policy years are prominently
disclosed warning customers against premature termination and ensuring
commitment matches product features like long-term protection. Post-sale service
includes claim assistance, policy servicing, premium reminders, and periodic
reviews ensuring customers receive ongoing support beyond initial sale. The Bank
advocates for customers with insurance companies during claim disputes
leveraging relationship strength ensuring fair treatment though ultimate claim
decisions rest with insurers. Customer complaints regarding insurance sales
receive priority investigation with remediation including policy cancellation,
premium refund, or compensation where mis-selling is established.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate health information, financial details, and
personal circumstances during needs assessment and insurance applications
enabling appropriate recommendations and preventing claim rejections. Insurance
purchase decisions should be based on genuine protection needs not purely
investment returns recognizing insurance's primary purpose is risk mitigation
not wealth creation. Policy documents including terms, conditions, exclusions,
and benefits should be read carefully before purchase; customers should seek
clarifications on unclear aspects rather than signing without understanding.
Customers should maintain premium payments regularly avoiding policy lapse which
eliminates protection and results in surrender value losses substantially below
premiums paid. Insurance needs should be reviewed periodically as life
circumstances change informing decisions about policy continuations, increases,
or termination when protection is no longer needed. Customers should compare
insurance options across multiple providers not just Bank-offered products
ensuring comprehensive market assessment before purchase. Claim procedures
including documentation requirements, timelines, and exclusions should be
understood upfront enabling smooth claims when needed rather than disputes after
incidents. Customers should resist pressure tactics for insurance purchases
taking time to evaluate suitability, consulting family or independent advisors,
and exercising cooling-off rights if hasty decisions prove unsuitable.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall partner only with insurance companies meeting minimum criteria
including financial stability ratings, claim settlement ratios, customer service
quality, and regulatory compliance records. Insurance advisor training includes
product knowledge, needs assessment techniques, disclosure obligations, ethical
selling, and regulatory requirements with annual recertification ensuring
competency. Needs assessment documentation captures customer situation, stated
needs, recommended products, and rationale creating audit trail for suitability
reviews and complaint investigations. Product comparison tools enable advisors
to present multiple suitable options with transparent comparison of features,
costs, benefits, and terms empowering customer choice. The Bank maintains
insurance product portfolio balance across protection-oriented and investment-
linked products avoiding overemphasis on high-commission investment products at
expense of pure protection. Sales monitoring includes transaction reviews,
customer callbacks, and pattern analysis detecting potential mis-selling
requiring intervention before harm to many customers. Claim support services
assist customers in claim filing, documentation, follow-up with insurance
companies, and escalation for delayed or disputed claims demonstrating
commitment beyond sales. Commission structures balance advisor incentives across
product types preventing distortion toward products benefiting advisors rather
than customers. The Bank conducts periodic insurance customer satisfaction
surveys assessing sales experience quality, product suitability, post-sale
service, and claim experiences informing improvement. Complaints regarding
insurance mis-selling trigger investigations within 5 business days with
remediation including policy cancellation, full premium refund, and advisor
consequences where mis-selling is confirmed.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Bank earns commissions from insurance sales creating potential conflicts of
interest between customer interests and Bank revenue managed through suitability
obligations and supervision. Insurance products have cooling-off periods
typically 15-30 days allowing cancellation; exercising this right results in
premium refund minus proportionate risk charges incurred. Policy illustrations
show projected returns based on assumptions about market performance and
persistence; actual returns may differ substantially particularly for
investment-linked products. Surrender values especially in early policy years
are significantly below premiums paid due to allocation charges, mortality
costs, and acquisition expenses making premature termination expensive.
Insurance claim approval ultimately rests with insurance companies not the Bank;
while the Bank assists and advocates, it cannot guarantee claim acceptance or
amounts. Medical underwriting for health and life insurance may result in
exclusions, premium loadings, or application rejections based on health status
discovered during assessment. Group insurance schemes for account holders or
borrowers may have master policy terms differing from individual policies
requiring careful review of actual coverage and benefits. Insurance products
distributed by the Bank are insurance company products not Bank products; credit
risk, performance risk, and obligation fulfillment are insurance company
responsibilities with Bank acting as facilitator.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with Insurance Ordinance provisions on corporate agents,
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations on bancassurance, and State Bank
guidelines on insurance product distribution. Insurance distribution activities
undergo quarterly compliance audits verifying advisor licensing, needs
assessment documentation, disclosure adequacy, and suitability compliance. The
policy is reviewed annually incorporating regulatory changes, insurance partner
performance, customer complaints analysis, and best practices in insurance
distribution. Insurance sales metrics are tracked alongside quality indicators
including policy persistency, claim ratios, customer complaints, and mis-selling
incidents preventing purely volume-driven evaluation. Customer complaints
regarding insurance sales are segregated and analyzed identifying products,
advisors, or practices requiring attention through training, supervision, or
product discontinuation. Staff compensation for insurance sales is reviewed
annually ensuring balance between productivity incentives and customer
protection obligations without excessive sales pressure creation. The Bank
maintains insurance partner performance dashboards tracking claim settlement
ratios, turnaround times, customer complaints, and service quality informing
partnership continuations or terminations. Mystery shopping periodically tests
insurance sales practices assessing needs assessment quality, disclosure
adequacy, and absence of pressure tactics with findings driving training and
supervision improvements.

4. Policy Statement
Amanah Bank distributes investment products and provides wealth management
services prioritizing customer suitability and risk-appropriate recommendations
over transaction volumes or fee generation. Comprehensive risk profiling
precedes investment recommendations assessing customer's investment knowledge,
risk tolerance, investment horizon, financial goals, and liquidity needs
determining appropriate risk-return profiles. Investment product recommendations
provide portfolio allocation across asset classes like debt, equity, and money
market instruments achieving diversification matching customer risk appetite
rather than concentrating in single products. Clear risk disclosure accompanies
investment recommendations explaining market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk,
and specific product risks ensuring customers understand potential losses
alongside return expectations. Performance projections for investment products
show multiple scenarios including adverse market conditions avoiding only
optimistic scenarios that create unrealistic expectations and future
disappointments. Fees and charges including management fees, entry loads, exit
loads, performance fees, and total expense ratios are disclosed transparently
enabling customers to assess cost impact on net returns. Conflict of interest
management ensures recommendations prioritize customer suitability over product
distribution commissions or proprietary product promotion with disclosure of
commission structures. Ongoing portfolio reviews for wealth management clients
include periodic performance reporting, rebalancing recommendations, and
adjustments for changed circumstances or goals maintaining long-term
appropriateness. The Bank facilitates investment transactions but investment
decisions remain customer responsibility; advisory relationships are non-
discretionary unless explicit portfolio management mandates are granted.
Investment product suitability is dynamic requiring periodic reassessment;
customers receive annual reviews evaluating whether existing investments
continue matching profiles and recommending adjustments. Vulnerable customers
including elderly persons, retirees, or financially unsophisticated investors
receive enhanced protection through conservative recommendations, detailed
explanations, and cooling-off periods for significant investments.
5. Customer Responsibilities
Customers must provide accurate, complete information about financial situation,
investment experience, risk tolerance, and goals enabling appropriate risk
profiling and product recommendations. Investment decisions should be based on
own assessment and understanding not blind reliance on advisor recommendations;
customers retain ultimate responsibility for investment outcomes. Product
literature, fund fact sheets, offering documents, and risk disclosures should be
read carefully before investments understanding what is being purchased beyond
sales presentations. Customers should diversify investments across products,
asset classes, and institutions avoiding concentration that magnifies risk
despite potential short-term underperformance of diversified portfolios.
Investment performance should be evaluated over appropriate horizons matching
product characteristics; short-term volatility is inherent in equity investments
requiring patient long-term perspective. Changed financial circumstances
including income loss, major expenses, or shortened horizons should be
communicated enabling portfolio adjustments before forced liquidations at
unfavorable times. Tax implications of investment returns including capital
gains, dividend taxation, and wealth reporting are customer responsibility
requiring tax advisory consultation for comprehensive planning. Unrealistic
return expectations should be tempered through self-education; consistently high
returns without commensurate risk are rare with past performance not
guaranteeing future results. Customers should report pressure tactics,
unsuitable recommendations, or inadequate disclosure through complaint channels
enabling investigation and protection of other customers from potential mis-
selling.
6. Bank Responsibilities
Amanah Bank shall maintain competent investment advisory teams with professional
certifications, continuous training, and expertise in financial markets,
products, and advisory best practices. Risk profiling uses standardized
questionnaires and tools ensuring consistent, objective assessment across
advisors and customers with periodic recalibration validating profile accuracy.
Investment product due diligence evaluates fund manager track records,
investment strategies, risk management, fee structures, and regulatory
compliance before distribution approval. Product shelf maintains diversified
options across risk levels, asset classes, and investment horizons enabling
suitable matches for different customer profiles rather than one-size-fits-all
offerings. Conflict management includes disclosure of distribution commissions,
separation of advisory and sales roles where feasible, and supervisory oversight
ensuring recommendations withstand suitability scrutiny. Portfolio performance
reporting provides transparent updates on investment values, returns, asset
allocation, and benchmark comparison enabling customers to monitor progress
toward goals. The Bank maintains investment markets expertise analyzing economic
trends, market developments, and outlook informing customer communications and
advisory recommendations. Customer education through seminars, webinars, market
commentaries, and educational content builds investment literacy enabling
informed participation in investment decisions. Complaint handling for
investment disputes includes investigation of suitability, disclosure adequacy,
and advisor conduct with remediation including investment reversal, fee refunds,
or compensation where mis-selling occurred. The Bank maintains professional
liability insurance covering investment advisory activities protecting customers
in cases where Bank errors cause investment losses beyond normal market risk.
7. Exceptions / Disclosures
Investment returns are market-dependent; the Bank cannot guarantee investment
performance with potential losses including principal loss especially in equity
and market-linked products. Past performance of investment products is not
indicative of future results; historical returns in marketing materials
represent specific periods which may not repeat. Investment advisory is provided
by Bank staff who may not hold independent financial advisor certifications;
customers seeking comprehensive financial planning may need specialized external
advisors. Distribution commissions from fund houses or product providers create
potential conflicts managed through disclosure and suitability processes but not
fully eliminated. Investment products distributed are third-party products not
Bank deposits; credit risk and performance risk are borne by product providers
not guaranteed by the Bank. Market volatility causes investment value
fluctuations sometimes significantly; customers should be prepared for temporary
losses without panic selling in bear markets. Liquidity constraints in some
investments including closed-end funds or real estate products mean selling
before maturity may be difficult or involve substantial discounts to fair value.
Tax laws change affecting investment taxation; customers should monitor tax
developments and seek updated tax planning advice annually. Wealth management
services serve affluent customers with minimum relationship values; mass-market
customers receive product sales support rather than comprehensive wealth
advisory.
8. Compliance and Review
This policy complies with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations on
investment advisors, mutual fund distribution rules, and State Bank guidelines
on bank-sponsored investment services. Investment advisory activities undergo
quarterly compliance reviews verifying risk profiling documentation, product
suitability, disclosure adequacy, and conflict management. The policy is
reviewed annually incorporating regulatory changes, investment product
evolution, market developments, and advisory best practices. Investment advisory
quality is assessed through customer satisfaction surveys, portfolio performance
analysis, complaint rates, and regulatory feedback informing training and
process improvements. Advisor performance evaluation balances assets under
management growth with quality metrics including suitability compliance,
customer retention, and satisfaction preventing purely sales-driven behavior.
Staff compensation for investment distribution is structured balancing revenue
with risk-adjusted metrics and customer outcomes avoiding short-term transaction
focus at expense of long-term customer welfare. The Bank benchmarks advisory
practices against wealth management industry standards adopting best practices
in client service, portfolio construction, and advisory processes. Investment
product provider relationships are reviewed annually assessing product
performance, service quality, commission competitiveness, and strategic fit
informing product shelf optimization.
