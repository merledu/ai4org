I t includes sample \npersonnel, accounting, financial management, procurement, and records management \npolicies, and has two distinct purposes: \n \n To provide emerging CDCs with sample policies and procedures so that they may be \nable to develop policies and procedures appropriate to their specific circumstances, \nand to provide their staff members with information regarding the type of systems \nthat may be adopted in their administration of federal funds; and  \n To provide mature CDCs with sample policies and procedur es to compare with their \nexisting manual and assess whether adequate systems are in place particularly with \nrespect to the administration of federal funds. \n \nPlease note that the sample policies and procedures presented in this manual is only one \nof many po ssible models that could meet federal regulations.  In many instances, an \nexisting policies and procedures manual may be suffice.  Prior to developing a policies and \nprocedures manual or adopting any of the sample policies and procedures attached, LISC \nstrongly encourages an organization to consult with legal counsel, accounting, financial , \nand/or human resource professionals.  By doing so, the organization will be able to \ndevelop policies and procedures to reflect its own organizational philosophy and incl ude \ninformation consistent with applicable state and local laws.  \n \n* LISC makes no legal representation concerning the accuracy of the information presented in \nthese sample policies and procedures manual or the manual’s compliance with federal, state \nor local laws. \n \n \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 3 of 67 \n \nTable of Contents \nIntroduction

........................................................................................... 67 \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 7 of 67 \nPURPOSE \n \nThe Board of Directors of      Community Development Corporation (“CDC”), has \ndeveloped and enacted the following policies and procedures by virtue of the by-laws of the \norganization. This manual was voted on by the board of directors and made effective on \n     . \n \nThe purpose of this manual is to serve as a reference tool to guide managers in the \nadministration of the company’s everyday operations and to acquaint employees with the \ninformation they need to understand those policies, practices and procedures.   \n \nSince it is not possible to anticipate every situation that may arise in the work place or to \nprovide information that answers every question, circumstances will undoubtedly require \nthat policies, practices, procedures and benefits change from time to time.  Accordingly, the \nBoard of Directors for      Community Development Corporation reserves the right to \nmodify, supplement, or rescind any of its policies, practices, procedures and benefits at any \ntime.   \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 8 of 67 \n \nPERSONNEL POLICIES \nPolicy on Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity \nStatement \n      CDC is an Equal Opportunity Employer and recruits, employs, retains, and promotes \npersons in all job titles without regard to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, color, \nalienage or citizenship, national or ethnic origin, age, transgender status, marital status, \nveteran status, carrier status or disability, except where there is a bonafide occupation \nqualification for the job tasks to be performed.  In such circumstances reasonable \naccommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities will be made unless doing \nso would result in an undue hardship.   \n \n      CDC will also ensure that all personnel actions such as compensation, benefits, \ntransfers, layoffs, recalls, transfers, leaves of absences compensation, and training will be \nadministered in accordance with the principles of equal employment opportunity.  \n \nCompliant Procedure \n      CDC does not discriminate against any employee, volunteer or consultant on the basis \nof race, color, cultural heritage, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital \nstatus, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, source of income, veteran status or \nany other status protected under local, state, or federal law. This policy extends to all \npersonnel decisions, terms and conditions of employment, vendor contracts and provision of \nservices. \n \nAt       CDC, we are committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment for all \nstaff and customers. No one, whether a manager, an employee, a consultant, or a member \nof the public, has to put up with harassment at       CDC, for any reason, at any time. And, \nno one has the right to harass anyone else, at work or in any situation related to \nemployment. \n \nHarassment is any behavior that degrades, demeans, humiliates, or embarrasses a person, \nand that a reasonable person should have known would be unwelcome. It includes actions \n(e.g. touching, pushing), comments (e.g. jokes, name-calling) or displays (e.g. posters, \ncartoons). Sexual harassment includes offensive or humiliating behavior related to a person’s \nsex, as well as behavior of a sexual nature that creates an intimidating, hostile, or “poisoned” \nwork environment, or that could reasonably be thought to put sexual conditions on a \nperson’s job or employment opportunities. \n \nIf you experience any job related discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, \nsexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, marital status, amnesty, or if you believe \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 9 of 67 \nyou have been treated in an unlawful, discriminatory manner, promptly report the incident \nto your supervisor.   \n \n     CDC will not disclose a complainant’s or alleged harasser’s name, or any circumstances \nrelated to a complaint, to anyone, except as necessary to investigate the complaint or take \ndisciplinary action related to the complaint, or as required by law. Managers involved in a \ncomplaint are reminded to keep all information confidential, except in the above \ncircumstances. \n \nEmployment  \n      CDC does not offer tenured or guaranteed employment. Thus, the Company or the \nemployee can terminate the employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason, \nwith or without cause, with or without notice. \n \nVacancies \nAll positions not filled by internal promotion of existing employees will be advertised, and all \napplicants will be considered for employment in compliance with all applicable federal, state \nand local laws.  \n \nHiring \n      Board of Directors has the responsibility of hiring the Executive Director upon \nrecommendation of the Executive Committee, which will interview and screen applicants.  \nThe Executive Director, with consultation of the Executive Committee and appropriate staff, \nhas the responsibility of hiring all other staff.   \n \nDuring the recruitment, hiring, and orientation process, no statement is to be made promising \npermanent or guaranteed employment; and no document should be called a contract unless, in \nfact, a written employment agreement is to be used.  When candidates from outside of the \ncompany are to be considered for job openings, the following procedures should be followed: \n \na) All candidates for employment must submit a resume. \nb) An interview will be arranged between the applicant and the Executive Director or head \nof the department with the job opening. \nc) The Executive Director or department head has the responsibility to determine whether \nan applicant is technically qualified for the position and if the applicant is compatible \nwith the work environment.   \nd) Reference checks are required from all final stage candidates.  Written references and \nnotes on verbal references, if any, become part of the employee's personnel file.   \ne) Any offer of employment is contingent on a satisfactory check of references and \nmisrepresentations in the process of application for employment may be grounds \nfor termination. \nf) Applicants must fill out and sign a Conflict of Interest Form and other pertinent \nemployment forms. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 10 of 67 \ng) Following a decision to hire the applicant, the Executive Director, department head or \nHuman Resources will make an offer of employment which should include any \ncontingencies or disclaimers deemed necessary.  This may include a limited term of \nemployment if a specified funding source, of limited duration, is to be used to fund \nthe position. \nIf the background, educational, conflict of interest, or other subsequent investigation discloses \nany misrepresentation on the resume or any other written material submitted to       CDC \nindicating that the individual is not suited for employment the applicant will be refused \nemployment or, if already employed, will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and \nincluding termination.   \n  \nA member of an employee's immediate family will be considered for employment provided the \napplicant possesses qualifications for employment.  An immediate family member may not be \nhired, if such employment would: \n \na) Create either a direct or indirect supervisor/subordinate relationship with a family \nmember; or \nb) Create either an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. \n \nThese criteria will also be considered when assigning, transferring, or promoting an employee.  \nFor purposes of this policy, \"immediate family\" includes: the employee's spouse, common-law \nspouse, qualified domestic partner, brother, sister, parents, children, step-children, father-in-\nlaw, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, and any other \nmember of the employee's household. \n \nEmployees who marry or become members of the same household may continue \nemployment as long as there is not: \n \na) A direct or indirect supervisor/subordinate relationship between such employees; or \nb) An actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a   conflict of interest. \n \n \nEmployment at Will \nEmployees hereby understand and acknowledge that, unless otherwise defined by applicable \nlaw, any employment relationship with       CDC is of an “at-will” nature.   \n \nEmployment at Will Disclaimer \n \nThis handbook does not constitute as a contract for employment for any period of time but \nmerely sets forth policies and procedures in effect on the date it was issued. The handbook \nmay be amended from time to time without prior notice to employees. Furthermore, \nadditional policies and procedures specific to particular job classifications may be added as \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 11 of 67 \nneeded. The Executive Director, is the only person, who has authority to enter into any \nagreement or make any promises or commitments contrary to the foregoing.  \n \nEmployment Status \nA normal workweek is Monday through Friday, during the hours of 8:30am to 7:00pm and \nconsists of thirty-five hours. A normal workday consists of eight consecutive hours of work \nwith a one hour unpaid lunch period usually taken between the hours of 12pm and 2pm.  \nBreaks are considered as time worked except as otherwise provided by law. The exact \nschedule of hours of work, including lunch and breaks are determined individually by the \ndepartment or office which employs the employee.   \n \nFull-time \nA full-time regular employee is one who works between      and       hours per week.    \n \nPart-time \nPart-time employees work less than full-time in a regular job slot. \n \nTemporary Employees \nA temporary employee is a person who is hired for a temporary period, generally less than \n      (     ) months. Temporary employees should have no expectation of continued or \nregular employment and cannot become a regular employee unless an offer of regular \nemployment has been made. Unless otherwise specified or as required by law, temporary \nemployees are not eligible for employee benefits.  \n \n Non-Exempt and Exempt Employees \nThe Federal Fair Labor Standards Act classifies employees as either non-exempt or exempt. \nNon-exempt employees receive hourly wages. Under federal law, non-exempt employees \nare entitled to minimum wage and, if they work more than       hours in a work week, they \nare entitled to overtime.  \n \nAn exempt employee is salaried and is exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. This customarily refers to professional, administrative and executive \npersonnel.  \n \nConsultants \nConsultants are contracted for a specific scope of work and/or time period and are not \nemployees of       CDC. \n \n \nAttendance \nEmployees are required to notify their immediate supervisor within one hour of the scheduled \nstarting time in the event of illness or other unforeseen circumstances that will result in \ntardiness or absence from work. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 12 of 67 \n \nAbsence without prior approval, including illness, will not be compensated unless the employee \nprovides proper notification of absence. Proper notification should be given to the immediate \nsupervisor or the person acting in place of the supervisor in his or her absence.  In case of \ncatastrophic emergency that makes notification impossible, an employee will provide a brief \nwritten explanation upon return to work. \n \n      CDC may require doctor's verification for return to work after any absence for illness or \ninjury of more than three consecutive day’s duration.        CDC reserves the right to request \ndoctor's verification of any illness or injury regardless of duration of absence with special \nemphasis on employee's capability to return to work and work restrictions, if any. \n \nWork Schedule and Pay Periods \nWork Schedule \nAll full-time employees typically work a      -hour,      -day week including meal breaks.  \nThe normal office hours of the organization are       [Monday through Friday from \n     :00 a.m. to      :00 p.m].  Non-exempt employees will be paid time and one half for \neach hour worked beyond 40 each week or will be awarded compensatory time at a rate of \none hour for every hour over forty hours worked during a single week. \n \nTime Reporting \nAll employees shall be required to complete time sheets on a weekly basis.  Employees \nwhose salary is funded from multiple federal, state or local sources are required to allocate \ntheir time accordingly to the various funding sources on their time sheet. \n \nNon-exempt employees  \nNon-exempt employees are required to complete an individual time record showing the daily \nhours worked.  Timesheets cover one pay period and are to be completed at the close of each \nworkday and be submitted to their supervisor the last day of the pay period.  The following \npoints should be considered in filling out time records: \n \na) Employees are to record their starting time, quitting time, and total hours worked for \neach workday. \nb) Employees are not permitted to sign in or commence work before their normal starting \ntime or to sign out or stop work after their normal quitting time without the prior \napproval of their supervisor. \nc) Employees are required to take a lunch or meal break. \nd) Employee timesheets are to be checked and signed by the supervisor.  Other time for \nwhich an employee is entitled to be paid (paid absences, paid holidays, or paid vacation \ntime) should be entered on the time record.  Overtime also should be entered. Time \nsheets should be signed by an immediate supervisor. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 13 of 67 \ne) Unapproved absences are not considered as hours worked for pay purposes.  \nSupervisors are to inform employees if they will not be paid for certain hours of \nabsence. \nThe filling out of another employee’s time record other than by a supervisor in the employee’s \nabsence or the falsifying of any time record is prohibited and may be grounds for disciplinary \naction, including termination. \n \nExempt Employees \nExempt employees are required to submit to their supervisor an Absence Record.  The Absence \nRecord must include any vacation, sick time or other leave taken. If the supervisor completed \nthe Absence Record during an employee's absence, the employee must countersign the \nAbsence Record upon his/her return. Absence Records must be approved by the employee's \nimmediate supervisor and forwarded to the      . \n \nAll employees have a responsibility to accurately report their time.  Failure to fulfill time \nreporting requirements may result in delay of salary payment or disciplinary action as \nappropriate. \n \nThe filling out of another employee's Absence Record other than by a supervisor in the \nemployee's absence or the falsifying of any Absence Record is prohibited and may be grounds \nfor disciplinary action, including termination. \n \nPay Practices \nPay Period \nEmployees will be paid on a bi-weekly cycle unless pay day falls on a holiday or weekend, in \nwhich case staff will be paid on the last working day before that holiday or weekend. Employees \nare encouraged to have direct deposit payroll. \n \nOn pay day employees will be sent a check in the office which they report for work or a pay stub \nshowing the pay that has been deposited in their bank account. New employees will receive a \npaycheck until direct deposit can be arranged.  \n \nDirect Deposit \nEmployees can \"Direct Deposit\" their payroll check into the bank of their choice by completing \nthe direct deposit application accompanying the package received at orientation or by \nrequesting a Direct Deposit form from Human Resources or the department in charge of \npayroll. \n \nThe Direct Deposit process can take up to three pay periods for completion.  During processing, \nemployees will continue to receive checks until the first electronic transfer takes place.  When \nthe \"Direct Deposit\" takes effect the employee will receive a pay stub showing the details of \nsalary payment and total amount deposited in the bank. \n   \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 14 of 67 \nAn employee should contact the       promptly upon noting a problem with the Direct \nDeposit process or change of banks.       CDC will work with the payroll company, if \napplicable, and the bank to rectify any problem, however,       CDC is not responsible for any \nerrors with the direct deposit process. \n \nWage Garnishments \nGarnishments are a legal procedure through which an employee's earnings must be withheld \nfor the payment of a debt. \n \nWhen a garnishment notice is received, the       will follow the appropriate Federal and State \nLaws relating to wage garnishments.  The       or       will make every effort to contact the \nemployee at this time concerning how the garnishment affects them and answer any questions \nregarding the process. \n \n \nOutside Employment  \n      does not wish to limit your outside activities or control your time outside of work hours \nas long as it does not interfere with your work performance or the business interests of the \norganization. If you work on a full-time basis,       considers itself your primary employer and \nrequires you to devote your full time and attention to your job duties each day while at work.  \n \nEmployee have a full-time responsibility to       CDC and may not engage in activities that \nmight interfere or conflict with the discharge of this responsibility, or in transactions that may \naffect the judgments they exercise on behalf of the company.  Accordingly,       CDC requires \nconformance with a variety of regulations governing service to outside organizations (as a \ntrustee, director, consultant, or in a similar capacity) as well as, disclosure of information, fees \nand payments, investments and other related issues. \n \nThe       does not automatically prohibit secondary employment however the employee \nmust obtain prior approval in writing for such employment. \n \nConflict of Interest \nNo employee will participate in activities or other employment that cause a conflict of \ninterest with the activities of       CDC. Activities or employment that create possible \nconflicts will be disclosed to the Executive Director in writing for review. \n Any employee of the organization, who accepts gifts or gratuities from individuals, \ncompanies, clients, or suppliers in conjunction with their job, will be subject to disciplinary \naction up to and including dismissal. \nNo       CDC employee is to become involved in real estate development, outside of his or \nher work at       CDC, in any neighborhood where CDC operates a program. \nNo officer or employee may serve as an official, director, or trustee of any for-profit or non-\nprofit enterprise without obtaining the approval of their immediate supervisor. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 15 of 67 \n      CDC encourages service with constructive and legitimate not-for-profit organizations.  \nParticipation in civic affairs is encouraged as part of our commitment to community \ninvolvement.  There are cases, however, in which organizations have business relationships \nwith the organization in which the handling of confidential information might result in a \nconflict of interest.  An employee’s immediate supervisor must be advised when a potential \nconflict exists. \n \nPolicy Prohibiting Unlawful Harassment, Including Sexual \nHarassment \nIt is the policy of        CDC that it will not tolerate verbal or physical conduct by any \nemployee which harasses, disrupts, or interferes with another’s work performance or which \ncreates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment. \n \nAs an equal opportunity employer, it is        CDC’s policy that every applicant and \nemployee shall enjoy a work environment free from all forms of unlawful harassment, \nincluding sexual harassment.  Unwelcome verbal, physical or visual conduct involving any \nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, national origin, \nancestry, citizenship, medical condition, physical disability, marital status, or military service, \nor any other basis protected by any federal, state or local law which impairs an employee’s \nability to perform their job is illegal and is strictly prohibited. \nSexual harassment is an unlawful employment practice under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 and various state laws.  The regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission define “sexual harassment” as follows: \n \nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct \nof a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: \n \na) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or a condition \nof an individual’s employment; and \nb) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for \nemployment decisions affecting such individual; or such conduct has the purpose or \neffect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating \nan intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.  \n \nSome examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, the following: \n \na) Unwelcome requests for sexual favors or dates. \nb) Unwelcome physical touching. \nc) Jokes or gestures that have a sexual content or sexual connotation. \nd) Posters or cartoons that have a sexual content or sexual connotation. \ne) Sending or forwarding written or electronic correspondence of a sexually explicit \nnature. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 16 of 67 \nf) Creating an otherwise offensive working environment or unreasonably interfering \nwith another’s ability to perform his or her job. \n \n      CDC does not condone sexual relationships between supervisors and their staff.  A \nrelationship of this type can easily be considered sexual harassment.  If such a relationship \ndevelops, one of the individuals must transfer to another position in the organization. \n \nBoth as a matter of law and common decency, each employee of       CDC is entitled to \npursue his or her employment, free of harassment or discrimination on any of the prohibited \nbases enumerated above.  Accordingly, unlawful harassment or discrimination against any \nemployee of       CDC will not be tolerated.  Violation of this policy may subject an \nemployee to discipline, up to and including immediate termination. \n \nAny employee who believes that he or she (or another employee) is the object of \nharassment or discrimination on any of the above-enumerated bases is strongly encouraged \nto follow the complaint procedure outlined below. \n \nAny employee may initiate the complaint procedure, without fear of reprisal, by immediately \nreporting such complaints to the: \n \na) the employee’s immediate supervisor. \nb) The      , if the employee feels that he or she is unable to report a complaint to his \nor her immediate supervisor. \nc) an officer of        CDC, if the employee feels that he or she is unable to report a \ncomplaint to the      . \n \n      CDC takes all complaints of harassment or discrimination seriously.  All complaints will \nbe investigated immediately by an impartial designee to be determined by senior \nmanagement of       CDC. \n \nAny employee who believes that the actions or words of a supervisor or fellow employee or \nsome other person(s) encountered in the workplace constitute unwelcome harassment has a \nresponsibility to report such incident as soon as possible to the appropriate supervisor, \nmanager or officer of       CDC.  Employees are encouraged to utilize the foregoing \ncomplaint procedure.  No employee will be retaliated against for having opposed unlawful \nharassment or discrimination, or for having filed a complaint or otherwise participating in an \ninvestigation concerning a complaint. \n \nEmployees are also notified that there are governmental agencies that handle claims of \nunlawful discrimination and harassment.  These agencies include the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission and parallel state agencies. \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 17 of 67 \nEach employee will be required to sign an acknowledgment of the Policy Prohibiting \nUnlawful Harassment, Including Sexual Harassment contained at the back of this manual. \n \nPersonnel Files and Employment Information \nAll staff members have a right of access to their personnel file, with the exception of access \nto reference checks that were obtained in confidence.  The staff member may review the \nfolder in the presence of their immediate supervisor.  It is the responsibility of the staff \nmember to provide information to their supervisor to keep personnel folders up-to-date \n(e.g., current resumes, change in marital status, name, address, telephone numbers, number \nof dependents, designated beneficiaries, education and training skills). \n \nThe employee’s immediate supervisor is authorized to verify the following information for a \nprospective creditor of an employee:  1) dates of employment; 2) title; and, 3) salary.  \nNeither the Executive Director nor any employee is authorized to provide a prospective \nemployer of a present or former employee of the organization with any information other \nthan dates of employment and title. \n \nResignation, Suspension, Termination, Reduction \n \nResignation \nEmployees who wish to resign from their positions should give       weeks written notice \nto their immediate supervisor with the reasons stated therein.  If       weeks notice is not \ngiven before resignation, the employee may lose any accumulated vacation time or other \nbenefits. \n \nSuspension \nSuspensions usually occur after verbal warnings or written warnings are issued. However, an \nemployee may be suspended by the Executive Director without pay for breach of client \nconfidentiality, unsatisfactory job performance, and/or just cause.  The Executive Committee \nmust review the facts of the case at or before the next regularly scheduled board meeting to \neither confirm or reverse the suspension.  The decision of the Executive Committee will be \ngiven in writing. \n \nTermination \nDismissal will be issued for unsatisfactory job performance, violation of the Personnel \nPolicies and Procedures, illegal acts, or any other just cause as determined by the Executive \nDirector.  Written notice of termination will be given with reasons for the action stated to \nthe employee.  Immediate termination will occur for breach of client confidentiality, theft, \nand/or just cause. Unsatisfactory job performance includes, but is not limited to excessive \nabsenteeism, tardiness, failure to cooperate with other employees, and unauthorized use of \ncompany property. In addition,       CDC reserves the right to terminate an employee at \nany time with or without notice, for any reason, or for no reason at all. For more details, \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 18 of 67 \nrefer to Corrective Action and Termination in Section Three Performance and Discipline \nsection. \n \nThe Board of Directors has the responsibility for the termination of the Executive Director \nupon recommendation of the Executive Committee in accordance with these policies.   \n \nIf a terminating employee is eligible for any incentive compensation, bonus, and/or awards, \nthey must be actively employed on the date the compensation, bonus and/or awards are \npaid. \n \nReduction \nIf an employee must be terminated due to a reduction in workforce, he or she will be \nnotified 30 calendar days prior to the event, if possible. \n \nGrievance Procedure  \nAn employee is encouraged to make use of the following grievance procedure after s/he has \nmade a good faith effort to approach the supervisor in an attempt to correct issues. \n \nStep 1: The employee shall present the initial grievance in writing to the immediate \nsupervisor within        (     ) working days after the event or action that is the basis for \nthe grievance. Promptly, and usually within three working days of receipt of the grievance, \nthe immediate supervisor will arrange a meeting with the employee. Soon afterwards, the \nsupervisor will provide the employee with a written response to the grievance. If the \nemployee does not agree with the response, the employee may forward the grievance to the \nExecutive Director within       (     ) working days of receipt of the supervisor’s written \nresponse.  \n \nStep 2: Promptly, and usually within        (     ) working days of receipt of a grievance, \nthe Executive Director will meet with the employee and the supervisor. Following this \nmeeting the Executive Director will promptly provide a written response to the employee. If \nthe employee does not agree with the response, the employee may forward the grievance to \nthe Executive Committee (Board Officers) within       (     ) working days of receipt of \nthe Executive Director’ written response.  \n \nThe Executive Committee will meet promptly to hear the employee’s grievance. Under most \ncircumstances, the meeting shall be within       (     ) working days of receipt of the \nrequest for an appeal. The Executive Committee will promptly furnish its findings to the \nExecutive Director and the employee. The decision of the Executive Committee shall be final \nand binding.   \n \nIf the employee feels intimidated or threatened by pursuing any of the steps in this grievance \nprocedure, s/he is urged to bring this concern directly and immediately to the Executive \nDirector. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 19 of 67 \n \nTravel and Other Expenses \nEmployees will be reimbursed for approved business travel and other expenses that is pre-\napproved by the employee’s immediate supervisor.  Travel expenses and other expenses \ninclude the following: \na) Mileage for employees using personal automobiles for travel will be reimbursed at \nthe current IRS approved mileage rate.  All requests for reimbursement will be \ndocumented on the approved reimbursement form available in the office. \nb) Mass transit, taxi or car service to carry out       business. Staff should consider \noverall costs before selecting a mode of transportation. Mass transit is by far the \nleast expensive. If feasible for the nature of your journey please take mass transport. \nReimbursement will be calculated on a per trip basis. \nc) Temporary dependent care costs (as defined by 26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond \nregular dependent care that directly result from travel to conferences, are a direct \nresult of the employee’s travel for work, and are only temporary during the travel \nperiod. Travel expenses for dependents will not be reimbursed. \nd) Personal meals incurred by an employee when eating on an out-of-town business \ntrip. Employees must travel more than 50 miles round trip from their home office to \nqualify for reimbursement. \ne) Business meals taken with clients, prospects or associates during which a specific \nbusiness discussion takes place. \nf) Tips included on meal receipt will be reimbursed. Tips should be no more than 20% of \nthe bill. \n \nWe strongly recommend that all       travel arrangements that require airfare and lodging \nbe book through       . If you are attending a conference that offers a reduced hotel rate at \nthe conference hotel, you should book your room directly to access the reduced rate, rather \nthan using      . Conference and workshop related travel must be approved by an \nemployee’s supervisor in advance of the trip. \nWhen traveling by air,       reimburses for economy class only. When traveling by rail, \ncoach travel, not the Acela, should be used. \n \nMake every effort to purchase the lowest possible fare. All airline travel should be booked at \nleast 14 days in advance of the trip. If an employee is booking their travel less than 14 days in \nadvance, such employee must provide written explanation on the expense report explaining \nwhy the trip was not booked 14 or more days in advance of the departure date. \n \nReimbursement requests may be submitted as often as once a month. Expenditures from the \nprevious fiscal year can be reimbursed only on requests received prior to the year-end closing \nof the books, by no later than      .\n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 20 of 67 \n \n \nPERFOMANCE AND DISCIPLINE \nPay Raises and Bonuses  \nPay raises and bonuses (if applicable) will be determined annually by the Board of Directors \nand the Officers of       CDC.  In the event that there are monies available for \ncompensation increases, these increases will be paid as salary and/or bonus according to \nexempt or non-exempt status and determined by attainment of performance standards.  \n \nBonus compensation may only be paid to exempt staff only. Bonuses are based on goal \nachievement in the previous year and are paid to both reward over achievement and as an \nincentive to continue future performance. Like pay raises bonus pay will be paid as salary.    \n \nPerformance Appraisals  \nThe Performance Appraisal process for Exempt and Non-Exempt employees is the foundation \nfor all compensation activity and provides a unique opportunity to unite the employee's \naccountabilities and achievements to the objectives and strategic plans of the organization.   \n \nSupervision and Evaluation \nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors is the direct supervisor of       CDC’s Executive \nDirector, and in conjunction with the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, will \nconduct an annual performance evaluation of the Executive Director. The Executive Director \nis the direct supervisor of each individual employee.  In the event that there are Program \nDirectors, the Program Directors are the direct supervisors of the support staff in their \nprogram.  \n \nPerformance Evaluations \n      believes in the importance of employee performance evaluations.  All employees will \nbe evaluated by their direct supervisor using established standards of performance for their \nposition, on a semi-annual basis in January and June.  The evaluation is based in job \nperformance with regard to applicable skills, productivity, quality of work, attitude and \ncooperation, dependability, job knowledge and effectiveness, and other areas applicable to \nspecific employee categories. Attendance and punctuality are a major factor in an \nemployee’s overall review.  \n \nInitial Evaluation \nThe immediate supervisor or the Executive Director (see above) will perform an evaluation, \nthree months after employment with the organization.   \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 21 of 67 \nCorrective Action and Employment Termination  \nMost employees want to do a good job.  Supervisors shall help employees succeed on the \njob by: \na) Providing a thorough orientation for new employees \nb) Clearly establishing expectations for behavior and performance \nc) Providing training, coaching, and mentoring \nd) Providing feedback through appropriate supervision \n \nHowever, in every workplace there will be situations where an employee fails to meet \nexpectations or where an employee commits acts of misconduct. There may be times when, \ndespite all of the supervisor's best efforts, the employee continues to demonstrate \nunsatisfactory performance or problem behavior. \n \nForms of Corrective Action  \nWhen corrective action is necessary, the amount and type of action taken depends on the \nparticular circumstances.       CDC maintains the discretion to determine what corrective \naction is appropriate in each situation, regardless of what correction the employee may have \nreceived previously. For example, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to give an \nadditional written warning before taking any stronger action, while in other circumstances it \nmay be appropriate to take strong action including termination, without any previous \nwarnings or suspensions.  \n \nThough other forms of corrective action are also possible, these are the types most often \ntaken.  \na) Counseling: If a supervisor becomes concerned about an employee’s performance at \nwork, s/he may meet with the employee to discuss concerns and develop ways to \naddress the concerns.  \nb) Oral Warning: The supervisor meets with the employee to review the prior \ndiscussions and state her/his continuing concern with the employee’s performance. \nThe supervisor should clearly identify the purpose of this meeting as an oral warning, \nwhich is part of the corrective action. A summary of the oral warning meeting may be \ngiven to the employee with a copy retained by the supervisor and a copy kept in the \nemployee’s personnel file.  \nc) Written Warning: If the employee’s performance does not improve after an oral \nwarning, or if circumstances otherwise warrant it may be necessary to give a written \nwarning to an employee which may include the following:  \ni. Current level of performance and areas requiring improvement  \nii. Specific level of performance expected in each of the identified deficiencies  \niii. Time frame for improvement  \niv. Steps the supervisor will take to support improvement  \nv. Specified time for follow-up meeting  \nvi. Consequences if performance does not improve, the employee should read \nand sign the written warning. In signing, the employee acknowledges that \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 22 of 67 \ns/he has read and understood the document. The signature does not imply \nagreement.  \n \nd) Termination:       may dismiss an employee when this action is in the \norganization’s best interest. Employees should remember that employment with the \n      is by mutual consent. Both employee and the agency are free to terminate the \nemployment relationship at any time and for any reason.  \n \nOccasions for Corrective Action \nListed below are some of the kinds of behavior or performance that may lead to corrective \naction. It is, of course, not possible to list all of the kinds of problems that may occur in the \nwork place; other kinds of behavior or performance may also lead to corrective action. \n \na) Unsatisfactory job performance  \nb) Excessive absenteeism or tardiness, or failure to contact supervisor about absence  \nc) Violation of      procedures or rules  \nd) Theft or willful damage of the property of the agency or other employees  \ne) Refusal to perform work as directed or willful neglect of duties  \nf) Violent or abusive behavior or language  \ng) Acceptance of any gifts, favors, other remuneration from any individual or firm \nhaving or proposing to have any relationship with the       \n \n \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 23 of 67 \n \nBENEFITS \nBenefits \n      CDC provides a benefits package for all eligible full and part-time employees which \ninclude the following: \n \nVacation Days \nVacation is accumulated from the start of employment for full time employees at the rate of \n      days per month, up to the first anniversary date of employment -       weeks vacation \nin the first year. It is not expected that employees will take a vacation within the first \n     months.  \n \nUpon completion of six months of service, employees may take their accrued vacation at any \ntime subject to the approval of their supervisor. \n \na) During the second year of employment and each year thereafter, full-time employees \nwill accrue vacation day credit at the rate of       days per month -       weeks \nvacation each year.  \nb) Accrued vacation days not to exceed       days may be carried over from one calendar \nyear to the next calendar year. \nc) Upon completion of one year service, employees may take up to a maximum of       \nweeks vacation at one time, subject to the approval of the supervisor. Any accumulated \nvacation over       days at year-end is forfeited. \nd) All eligible staff members receive vacation pay based on their regular earnings, not \nincluding overtime or other additional compensation. \ne) The base period for computing vacation time is the anniversary date of employment. \nf) Vacation time may be taken in full day or half day increments. \ng) If an authorized holiday occurs during an employee's approved vacation period, the \nemployee will be paid for the holiday and therefore uses one less vacation day than \ntotal number of days in the vacation period. \nh) Part-time employees accrue vacation time on a pro-rated basis. \ni) Hourly part-time employees are not eligible for vacation, personal or sick time. \nj) Approval of the employee's vacation will be obtained from the immediate supervisor \nsubject to       CDC business needs.  All employees should notify their immediate \nsupervisors as far in advance of their planned vacation as possible.  The supervisor will \nforward authorized vacation requests to the Payroll Manager. \nk) An employee may request that an absence for illness in excess of the time allowed \nunder sick day accrual be taken as vacation time and charged against his/her \naccumulated vacation.  This request requires approval of the staff member's immediate \nsupervisor and      .   \n \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 24 of 67 \nPersonal Excused Absence \nPersonal excused absence is available to staff members from date of hire.        personal \nexcused absence days are provided on a calendar year basis and cannot be carried over.  \nUnused days will not be compensated. \n \nPart-time staff members are eligible for personal excused absence days on a pro-rated basis \nwith prior approval of their supervisor. \n \nPersonal Sick Leave \nPersonal sick leave will be accumulated as follows:       days at one year of service,       \ndays at      years of service, and      days at      years of service.  Any unused sick \nleave will be forfeited at year’s end.  All accumulated sick time is also forfeited upon \ntermination of employment for any reason. \n \nBereavement \n      working days of paid bereavement leave will be granted to employees who have a \ndeath in the immediate family.  The immediate family is defined as grandparents, parents, \nchildren, spouses, domestic partners and siblings.  \n \nBereavement leave for death of any person other than immediate family must be approved \nby your immediate supervisor and the department head. Absence for such a death is limited \nto        (     ) days and will be unpaid.  \n \nHolidays \n      CDC recognizes the following paid holidays: \n \n1. New Year’s Day 6. Labor Day \n2. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 7. Columbus Day \n3. President’s Day 8. Veteran’s Day \n4. Memorial Day 9. Thanksgiving \n5. Independence Day 10. Christmas Day \n \n \nOn National Election Day       CDC allows all staff up to       hours time off to vote, or time \noff as required by local law  An employee must notify his/her supervisor in advance when time \noff to vote is to be used. \n \nLeave of Absence (non FMLA) \nEmployees are eligible to apply for an unpaid leave of absence if they have been a regular \nemployee for at least one year and scheduled to work       hours or more per week. \nEmployees requesting an unpaid leave of absence must do so in writing at least       days \nin advance unless it is impractical to do so, in which case the employee must provide as \nmuch written notice as possible.  The request must be submitted to the Executive Director.  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 25 of 67 \nGranting of such leave is at the discretion of the Executive Director except in such cases \nwhere granting of leave is required by law, such as the Family Medical Leave Act. \n \nJury Duty \nCDC supports employees called to fulfill their civic duty to serve on jury duty. Employees \nmust provide his/her immediate supervisor with a copy of the jury duty summons. In \naddition, the employee and will receive his/her regular salary, up to       hours per week, \nfor a maximum of       (     ) weeks. \n  \nAdequate proof of service must be provided to receive your regular salary during jury duty. If \nthe amount you are compensated by the court, per day, exceeds ($     ) dollars per day, \nyour regular pay will be offset by the excess offset.  \n \nWorker’s Compensation \nEmployees who are injured on the job are covered by Worker’s Compensation Insurance. It is \nyour responsibility to immediately notify your immediate supervisor or one on duty. The \nsupervisor will notify your personnel representative.       CDC encourages injured \nemployees to seek immediate medical attention.  \n \nDisability Leave \nA disability leave of absence should be requested in writing and should be submitted to an \nemployee’s immediate supervisor as soon as practical and with a doctor’s recommendation \nand medical documentation.  The request should indicate the date on which the employee \nwill stop work and a projected return date.        CDC will hold the job or one at the same \nlevel of any employee on disability leave for a period of up to       months. \n \nAfter the employee’s sick leave is exhausted, vacation and/or compensatory time may be \nused for continued absence. \n \nThe employee will contact their immediate supervisor as soon as possible regarding their \nintentions to return to work or not, following an absence due to illness.  Pregnancy will be \nconsidered a temporary medical disability for purposes of this document.  \n \nA leave of absence for disability purposes will not constitute a break in tenure for purposes \nof calculating length of service; however, no additional sick leave or vacation time will be \naccumulated during the absence. \n \n \nMilitary Service \nFull-time, regular employees who are inducted in the Armed Forces are considered to be on \nleave of absence without pay and accrue only those benefits specified by law.  Upon \ncompletion of military assignment, the employee is eligible for rehire in their former job or a \njob of similar status and pay providing the following conditions are met: \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 26 of 67 \nThe employee must have been employed in a position other than temporary before their \ninduction; \na) They must have left their job to enter military service; \nb) They must have received certificate(s) of satisfactory completion of military service; \nc) They must apply for re-employment within       calendar days of their discharge; \nand, \nd) They must be able to perform the duties of their former job or a job of similar status. \n \nVeterans will be re-employed with the same seniority, status, and pay they would have had if \nthey had not entered military service. \n \nNational Guard/Reserves \nStaff members who are members of the National Guard or the Reserve will be granted a \nleave of absence for any period or required service with their unit other than normal tour \nduty.  All benefits will accrue during such periods and such duty will not be considered a \nbreak in service.  The employee must be reinstated in their position providing they meet all \nof the conditions listed under Military Service (Section G) with the following exception: \n \nThe employee must report to work at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled working \nperiod following their release from duty. \n \nEmployees who must take time off to participate in the Reserve or National Guard must \nsubmit a written request for leave to the immediate supervisor indicating the period of \nabsence and the expected return date. \n \nParental Leave \nParental leave is available for employees who become parents or have special needs associated \nwith the birth or adoption of a child.  The Parental Leave Plan provides for a combination of \npaid and unpaid.  Employees are eligible for Parental Leave after at least one year or service and \nhave worked at least       hours during the       months before becoming a parent. The \nemployee must also have become a parent through birth or adoption of a child and the child \nmust live in the staff member's household. If all of the above circumstances are met, the \nfollowing conditions apply: \n \na) An eligible employee who becomes a parent may receive up to       weeks of leave at \nfull pay per year.  Leave may begin       weeks before birth or adoption, or within \n      months after birth or adoption, at the staff member's option.   \nb) During the four weeks of paid leave, the employee will continue to receive and to \naccrue benefits for which he/she was eligible before beginning leave, i.e. coverage \nunder       CDC health plan, contributions to the Pension Plan and accrual of vacation \nand sick leave time. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 27 of 67 \nc) Leave need not be taken consecutively, but must be taken in the time period from four \nweeks before to       months after the date the employee becomes a parent. A \nschedule for the use of Parental Leave must be approved by the immediate supervisor. \nd) Unpaid leave may be used to extend the time off due to birth or adoption of a child but \nexcept for the employee’s medical disability total Parental Leave may not exceed three \nmonths.  Total Parental Leave is all leave paid and unpaid due to the birth or adoption of \na child.  Health benefits will continue during the period of unpaid leave. Please see the \nFamily and Medical leave section of this Guide for additional information. \ne) In cases where both parents are eligible       CDC employees, a combined total of \n      weeks of fully paid Parental Leave will be permitted.  The parents may divide the \nleave between them as meets their need. \nf) A staff member who returns from Parental Leave on a timely basis will be restored to his \nor her former position or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay and \nother terms and conditions of employment.  Certain \"key\" employees, i.e., those who \nare among the highest paid 10 percent of employees may be denied restoration to his \nor her former position in order to prevent \"substantial and grievous economic injury\" to \nthe company. \ng) A staff member's use of any other leave entitlement will not result in a reduction of \nParental Leave benefits, except that Parental Leave shall be counted against the time \navailable for childbirth or adoption and unpaid leave taken under the Family and \nMedical Leave Plan for the adoption or birth of a child be counted against the maximum \nleave allowed under       CDC Parental Leave Plan. \nh) Leave unused under this policy is not payable in cash, nor can it be converted to any \nother benefit.  It may not be delayed or extended beyond       months from the date \nthat the employee became a parent. \ni) Any time away from work taken by an employee under       CDC Parental Leave Policy \nshall be counted towards the       weeks of leave available to such employee under \nthe Family and Medical Leave policy. \n  \nFamily and Medical Leave \n      CDC is committed to providing family and medical leave to all eligible employees (as \ndescribed below) in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") of 1993 (the \n\"Act\"). \n \nEmployees are eligible for an unpaid leave if they have worked for       CDC at least one year, \nand have worked at least       hours over the       months preceding leave.  This policy is \napplicable to eligible employees regardless of status (e.g., single, employee with spouse or \nemployee with domestic partner). \n \nReasons for Leave \nAn eligible employee shall be entitled to a family or medical leave for one or more of the \nfollowing reasons: \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 28 of 67 \na) the birth of a son or daughter and to care for the new born child if the leave is taken and \nconcluded within       months of the birth of the child; \nb) The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care if the leave is \ntaken and concluded within       months of the placement of the child; \nc) to care for an employee's spouse, child or parent (“family member”) with a \"serious \nhealth condition;\" and \nd) because of an employee's own serious health condition which makes him or her unable \nto perform the functions of his or her job. \n \nWith regard to the illness of an employee or family member, FMLA leave generally does not \napply to brief illnesses, such as absences of less than        calendar days which do not involve \nongoing treatment by a physician or health care provider.  Leave under this policy is permissible \nonly for a \"serious health condition,\" which is intended to cover conditions which require \nhospitalization or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. \n \nThe availability of this unpaid leave does not affect the employee's eligibility, if any, for short or \nlong term disability for serious illnesses. However, if any employee takes short or long term \ndisability, the period of receiving such disability benefits shall be counted towards the \nmaximum 12 week period of unpaid leave available under      ’s Family and Medical Leave \npolicy. \n \nLength of the leave \nEligible employees may take up to       weeks of unpaid leave within a       month \nperiod.  However, if both parents (including domestic partners) work for       CDC, they are \neligible for a combined leave of      weeks in a      month period for the birth, adoption \nor foster care placement of a child.  Each employee is eligible for       weeks because of his \nor her own serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious health \ncondition. \n \nIn determining eligibility for leave,       CDC shall use a \"rolling\"      month period \nmeasured backward from the start of the employee's leave period.  Any time leave is \nrequested,       CDC shall determine how much leave the employee has taken during the \nimmediately preceding      months.  The employee shall be entitled to the balance of the \n     weeks which has not been used.  Total Parental Leave taken by the employee during the \nyearly \"rolling\"      month period is concurrently FMLA leave and shall be deducted from the \n     weeks of unpaid leave available under the Family and Medical Leave Plan. \n \nNotice and Medical Certification  \nWhen the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide thirty days advance notice \nbefore leave is to begin.  If leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide as much notice \nas is practicable.  The failure to provide the required notice may result in the denial of the leave \nuntil proper and timely notice is given. \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 29 of 67 \nWhen an employee is taking leave because of his or her own serious health condition, the \nemployee must comply with the documentary requirements of       CDC short term disability \nplan.  When an employee is taking leave because of a family member's serious health condition, \nthe employee shall be required to submit certification from a health care provider to \nsubstantiate the request. The completed certification must be submitted within       days of \nthe requested leave, except in unusual circumstances.  Failure to provide the required medical \ncertification may result in the denial of all privileges and benefits under this policy.  An \nemployee may also be required to provide subsequent recertification to support any continuing \nFMLA medical leave. \n \nInsurance Retirement \n      CDC provides a benefit package to all full-time employees which includes the \nfollowing: \n \na) Individual or Family Health Insurance \nb) Short and Long Term Disability \nc) 403b – retirement \nd) Life Insurance \n \nGroup Insurance \n      CDC makes health insurance, life insurance and accidental death coverage (group \nbenefits) available to eligible employees and their eligible family members.  \n \nShort Term Disability  \nShort term disability benefits are designed to provide a pay check to employees during \nperiods of serious illness resulting in total disability by providing a continuation of income \nduring periods of serious illness resulting in total disability. Regular full time employees are \neligible for STD benefits and may consult with your immediate supervisor or HR office for \nmore detailed information on eligibility. \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 30 of 67 \n \nACCOUNTING, AUDIT AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \nPOLICIES \nAccounting Policies \n \nIt shall be the policy of       CDC to create and maintain accounting, billing, and cash \ncontrol policies, procedures and records which are consistent with Generally Accepted \nAccounting Principles (GAAP) and meet the requirements of 2 CFR  200.302. \n \n       CDC‘s fiscal year starts on       1 and ends on     . \n \n      uses the accrual basis of accounting for all transactions consistent with GAAP. \n \n      CDC accounting, audit, and financial management policies are designed to do the \nfollowing: \n \na) Protect and secure the assets of       CDC. \nb) Ensure the maintenance of accurate, current and complete records of the financial \nresults of each award. \nc) Identify the source and application of all federal award funds. \nd) Ensure compliance with governmental and private funder reporting requirements. \ne) Bank accounts are established as required by donors and funding requirements. \nf) The Executive Committee must authorize all bank accounts and approves all check \nsigners. The approval of signers shall be reflected in the Board of Director’s meeting \nminutes. \ng) Bank transfers are scheduled and investigated to ascertain that both sides of the \ntransaction are recorded. \nh) Compare expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award to ensure that \ncosts do not exceed the budgeted amounts. \n \nCash Management  \nConsistent with 2 CFR 200.305, payment methods will minimize the time elapsing between \nthe transfer of funds from the United States Treasury or a pass-through entity and the \ndisbursement by       CDC whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer, or \nissuance or redemption of checks, warrants, payment by other means.       CDC will also \nminimize idle cash balances. \n \nPayments \nChecks \nAll checks above $      written on       CDC accounts require two authorized signatures. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 31 of 67 \nAll persons approved to sign checks will formally be approved by the CDC’s Board of \nDirectors. \n \nThe payee and check signer cannot be the same person. Other authorized persons shall sign \nreimbursement checks payable to a check signer. \nBanks should promptly be notified of all changes of authorized check signers. \nAll checks are to be pre-numbered and accounted for by a check custodian (used, voided, \nand not used). \nVoided checks are to be properly defaced and maintained. \nBank reconciliations to the general ledger are to be done monthly and provided to the \nExecutive Director or Treasurer at regular Board meeting. \n \nPayment of Bills \nTwo authorized persons should approve all bills. The Executive Director,       and/or \nauthorized person must approve, in writing, all invoices for payment via e-mail, initials, \nsignature or stamp. \nVendor invoices must be recalculated on site to ensure accuracy. This recalculation must \noccur prior to the preparation of a check to pay the invoice. After the recalculation is \ncomplete, the employee who performed the recalculation must initial the vendor invoice, \nindicating the amount is correct and the invoice can be paid.   \nChecks for payment are signed only when supported by approved invoices (checks will not \nbe processed and signed in advance of proper invoicing approval procedures). \nCheck signers should compare supporting data/documents against checks presented for \ntheir signature. \nThe employee responsible for mailing checks will not be responsible for recording cash \ndisbursements. These two functions must be handled by different employees to ensure that \nthe appropriate checks and balances are in place. \nAll costs must be considered reasonable. A cost is reasonable if it does not exceed that which \nwould be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the \ndecision was made to incur the costs. \n \nCash/Petty Cash \nPetty cash should be used for such things as small and odd jobs, local travel and sundry \nitems.  It is not intended for purchases that can be made with designated suppliers.  \nActivities or needs should be planned ahead so necessary funds will be available in the petty \ncash account. \n \nReceipts or itemized slips are required for every petty cash disbursement.  The Executive \nDirector or his/her designee will be responsible for verification of receipts and cash. \nWhenever petty cash is used, a pre-numbered “Receipt of Petty Cash” slip must be filled out.  \nA completed slip will include date, the amount taken and returned, the cash category and \nthe total spent.  When a staff person receives cash, he/she will sign on the “Received By” line \nof the petty cash log.  Items purchased should also be listed on the log, unless the receipt \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 32 of 67 \nthat must always be clipped to the log lists items purchased.  The Executive Director or \nhis/her designee will sign on the “Approved By” line of the petty cash log. \nThe Finance Officer will be responsible for the reconciliation and replenishment of the petty \ncash account. \n \nCash Receipts \nSomeone other than the person making deposits is responsible for opening the daily mail, \nmaking a log of cash receipts, restrictively endorsing the payment, making note of any \nrestrictions on the log entry, and account coding the receipt by receivable or revenue \naccount. \nThe Executive Director or an authorized person should prepare all bank deposit slips, listing \neach item separately. \nReceipts are deposited daily or kept in a safe.  For all deposits the bank’s stamped duplicate \ndeposit slip should be attached to the remittance documentation. \nThe deposit log with the duplicate deposit slips should be forwarded to the Financial Officer \nfor verification and data entry. \nAll cash should be deposited in the appropriate bank account based on funding restrictions. \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 33 of 67 \n \nSAMPLE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES \n \nTWO PERSON DISTRIBUTION OF \nDUTIES \nTHREE PERSON DISTRIBUTION OF \nDUTIES \nFOUR PERSON DISTRIBUTION OF \nDUTIES \nIndividual A Individual A Individual A \nOpen and review bank statements Open and review bank statements Open and review bank \nstatements \nOpen mail and prepare list of checks \nreceived \nReview accounts receivable aging Review accounts receivable aging \nReview accounts receivable aging Void invoices and or create credit \nmemos \nSign checks \nVoid invoices and/or create credit \nmemos \nApprove invoices Review accounts payable aging \nApprove invoices Sign checks Sign payroll checks \nSign checks Review accounts payable aging Perform interfund transfers \nReview accounts payable aging Void checks and/or create debit \nmemos \nReconcile petty cash \nVoid checks and/or create debit \nmemos \nApprove employee timesheets Individual B \nApprove employee timesheets Sign payroll checks Physical access to petty cash or \nundeposited funds \nSign payroll checks Distribute payroll checks Create invoices \nDistribute payroll checks Sign employee contracts Enter records into general ledger \nSign employee contracts Perform interfund transfers Approve payroll \nPerform interfund transfers Reconcile petty cash Sign employee contracts \nReconcile petty cash   \nIndividual B Individual B Individual C \nPhysical access to petty cash, and/or \nundeposited funds  \nPhysical access to petty cash and/or \nundeposited funds \nOpen mail and prepare list of \nchecks received \nReconcile bank statements Create invoices Prepare bank deposit \nCreate invoices Enter records into general ledger Write/print checks \nEnter records into general ledger Approve payroll  \nPrepare bank deposit   \nWrite/print checks Individual C Individual D \nApprove payroll Reconcile bank statement Reconcile bank statements \n Open mail and prepare list of checks \nreceived \nVoid invoices and/or create \ncredit memos \n Prepare bank deposits Approve invoices \n Write/print checks Void checks and/or create debit \nmemos \n  Approve timesheets \n  Distribute payroll checks \n   \nIndividual A = Executive Director or other top manager/board member  \nIndividual B = Primary accounting assistant or office manager \nIndividual C = Second accounting assistant or another manager level employee  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 34 of 67 \nIndividual D = Another manager level employee \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 35 of 67 \nCash Disbursements \nAll cash disbursements should be made by check (with the exception of petty cash). \n \nGeneral Ledger Account Coding \nAll cash receipts and disbursements should be accounted for, coded, and reviewed by the \nExecutive Director,       or authorized person. \n \nFunding from multiple sources may be kept in a bank account with other funding; however, \nit must be tracked independently.       CDC will establish separate set of account for each \ngrant within its chart of accounts and general ledger.  \n \nSupporting documentation should be noted as paid and include the check number, date \npaid, and general ledger account code.   \n \nAccount coding for each payment is reviewed for accuracy. \n \n      CDC finance and accounting staff will ensure that all costs paid through the utilization \nof external funding sources are recognized as ordinary, necessary, within the budget, are \narms-length transactions, and do not deviate from established practices of the organization. \n \nRevenue \nRevenue is earned using the accrual basis of accounting. \n \nCost reimbursement grants or contracts earn revenue when the expenses are incurred (not \ncommitted). \n \nExpense and Cost Allowability \nWhen there are Federal funds involved,       CDC will follow 2 CFR 200 Subpart E, the cost \nprinciples. In these instances, programs and grants will not be charged for 2 CFR 200 \nunallowable items such as, but not limited to: entertainment, fundraising expenses, \nlobbying, selling and marketing, bad debts, fines or penalties or interest on debt. \n \nBefore       CDC seeks reimbursement from a funder, it will ensure that the costs are \nconsidered allowable under the federal grant. Costs cannot be considered allowable unless \nthey: \na) are necessary, reasonable and allocable to that funder and within the grant period \nb) are adequately documented,  \nc) have not been allocated to or included as a cost of used to meet cost sharing or \nmatching requirements of any other federal award in either the current or a prior \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 36 of 67 \nperiod, except when allowed by federal law or regulation. \nd) Expenses are charged to grants based upon a shared cost rationale when the direct \ncharge cannot be established. A cost will not be assigned to a federal award as a \ndirect cost if any other cost of the same purpose in like circumstances has been \nallocated to the federal award as an indirect cost. \n \nExpenditures for each grant, loan, or contract are to be recorded according to the budget \ncategories for that particular funding source.   For each funding award,       CDC will \nmaintain records that allow for a comparison of outlays with approved budget amounts. \n \nLoan Loss Reserve (Only Applicable for CDCs that Make Loans) \nPeriodically, members of the Executive Committee, the Executive Director, and members of \nthe finance and accounting department should meet to review the adequacy of the \norganization’s loan loss reserve  Necessary adjustments should be determined and made at \nleast quarterly. \n \nCollection of Delinquent Accounts. \n      CDC may utilize outside collection agencies if all past efforts to collect outstanding \ndebt are exhausted. \n \nUpon approval from the Board of Directors, the Executive Director has discretionary \nauthority to submit delinquent debts (over 90 days) to an outside collection agency. \n \nWrite-off of Delinquent Debts/Charges \nBefore writing off any delinquent debts records must indicate that all efforts to obtain \npayment have been exhausted.  \n \nThe Executive Director of       CDC has the discretion to approve debt write-offs of a \nboard-authorized amount.  Any amount above the board-authorized amount should be re-\nsubmitted to the board for approval. \n \nIf collection is made of a debt previously written-off as uncollectible, it will be recognized as \nrevenue in the current period. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 37 of 67 \n \nFinancial Reporting Procedures \nThe Chief Financial Officer will be responsible for compiling monthly and year-to-date \nreports by revenue source, expense code, and asset and liability account balances. \n \nFinancial reports are reconciled to the general ledger and accounting records prior to \nsubmission to the funding source. \n \nIf an expenditure is different from an external funding source’s approved budget, prior \napproval must be obtained from the funding source prior to the submission of the financial \nreport. \n \nMonthly financial reports which analyze       CDC’s financial position and the effectiveness \nof its management and programs will be presented to the Executive Committee of the Board \nof Directors and also reported within the board packets. \n \nPeriodic reports will be provided to all funders as requested or required by contract. \n \n      CDC’s finance and accounting staff will maintain records that identify the source and \napplication of funds for all activities.  These records shall contain information pertaining to \nawards, authorizations, obligations, assets, outlays, income and interest.  Records will also \ninclude copies of contracts, invoices, proof of payments and allocation tracking when costs \nare distributed among several funding sources. \n \nInvestment/Banking Policies \nThe       CDC Board of Directors will approve the placement of assets not needed for \nimmediate operations assuring compliance with all contractual requirements and using the \nprinciples identified below.    \n \nPrinciples: \nMinimize Risk: The Board will define a minimum risk strategy that will be reviewed annually \nto ensure appropriate discharge of responsibilities to donors, lenders, and contractual \nrelationships. \n \nMaximize Investment Return: Within the parameters defined in “minimum risk”, funds will \nbe invested at the highest interest rate/return available at the time of decision. \n \n      CDC will support local, women-owned and minority-owned banks and institutions, if \neconomically feasible: “local” is defined as having a physical presence within       CDC’s \nservice area. \n \n      will maintain advances of federal funds in the best reasonably available interest \nbearing account, unless 2 CFR 200.305(b)(8) apply. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 38 of 67 \n \n      account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal \ncash balances. \n \n      CDC will keep all funds available not already invested in a federally insured bank. \n \n \nProcedures: \nEach quarter, the Executive Director or his/her designee will review with the Executive \nCommittee the projected cash needs of the corporation and the assets available for \ninvestment. \n \nEach quarter, the Executive Committee will provide the Executive Director or his/her \ndesignee with guidance regarding investments and institutions. \n \nThe Executive Director or his/her designee will contact local institutions as needed to \ndetermine the best rate of return for investments. \n \nEach year, the Board of Directors will define a policy for minimizing risk and review it \nannually. \n \nBudget Principles/Procedures \nThe structure of the budgetary process should be made in accordance with the mission, by-\nlaws of the organization and align with the requirements of any funding partners. \n \nBudget Principles \nThe budgetary process shall comply with the organization’s funding partners and in \naccordance with applicable state and federal laws. \n \nThe budgetary process shall comply with the guidelines and principles set forth by the Board \nof Directors. \n \nAnnually, each program area shall identify and develop a plan for its operation.  Each budget \nmust be approved by the Board of Directors or Executive Director. \n \nProcedures \nThe organization’s Executive Director will prepare and submit an operating budget to the \nBoard of Director’s 30-60 days prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year. \n \nDifferences in budget line items between the organization’s operating budget and a funders’ \napproved budgets will be resolved in negotiations between the Executive Director and the \nfunding agency. \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 39 of 67 \nAdjustments in Budget/Spending Plans \nAny adjustments or changes in spending policies/budget plans which vary by more than 10% \nfrom the original approved budget must be initialed by the Executive Director and submitted \nfor approval to the Board of Directors. \n \nThese changes will be communicated in writing to funding sources or s required by \ncontractual agreements. \n \nIf proposed changes are unsatisfactory to the funder, the Executive Director will \ncommunicate this response to the Board of Directors, who may authorize: \n \nChanging the budget/plan to one which is satisfactory to the funder; or \n \nEntering into negotiations to develop a compromise satisfactory to the funder and the Board \nof Directors. \n \nAfter all parties have approved the changes, the changes will be communicated in writing to \nall affected management staff. \n \nAudit Procedure \nAn independent audit should be performed by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) at the \nconclusion of each fiscal year. \n \nThe auditor(s) should complete the audit within       months of the conclusion of the fiscal \nyear. \n \nThe auditor(s) should test accounting mechanisms in accordance with generally accepted \nauditing standards for not-for-profit organizations and as contractually required by funding \nsources.  \n \nThe audit should conduct an A-133 audit, if the       CDC expends over $500,000 in federal \nfunding. Audits of fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2015 will increase threshold to \n$750,000. \n  \nA formal written report of the audit will be presented to       CDC’s Board of Directors and \nif necessary each principal funding source. \n \nWhistleblower Policy  \nThe       CDC requires Board of Directors members, officers, other employees and \nvolunteers to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their \nduties and responsibilities. Employees and representatives of the       CDC must practice \nhonesty and integrity in fulfilling their responsibilities and comply will all applicable laws and \nregulations.  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 40 of 67 \n \nEach Board Member, volunteer, and employee of the charity has an obligation to report in \naccordance with this Whistleblower Policy (a) questionable or improper accounting or \nauditing matters, and (b) instances where one suspects that employees and representatives \nof the       did not practice honesty and integrity or comply with all applicable laws and \nregulations.  \n \nShould a director, officer, employee, contractor, volunteer or agent of the       have a \nconcern or complaint regarding the accounting, auditing or reporting of, or the internal \ncontrols practices and procedures relating to the organization’s funds, the following \nguidelines shall be followed:  \n  \nContact the Executive Director of the by telephone (     ), mail (     ) or in person to \nsubmit the complaint. If the complaint involves the Executive Director contact the Board \nChair. Updated contact information for the individuals shall be posted on the website of \nthe     . Submissions may be made anonymously.  \n  \nUpon receipt of the complaint, the Executive Director (or the Board Chair) shall conduct an \ninitial screening of the complaint to assess its nature, legitimacy and significance. If in the \ncourse of the initial screening or at any time thereafter, it is determined that the complaint \nmay implicate the Executive Director, he or she shall notify the Board Chair of that fact, and \nthe Board Chair shall determine whether the Executive Director may continue with the \ninvestigation or appoint another person to assume the investigation instead.  \n \nUpon conclusion of the initial screening, the Executive Director (or the Board Chair or the \nExecutive Director’s appointee) shall decide whether to report the complaint in full to the \nBoard of Directors, proceed with further investigation or close the file. Any complaint \ninvolving (i) the existence of material inaccuracies in the      ’s financial reports or (ii) fraud \nor other intentional misconduct with respect to its accounting, auditing, reporting or internal \ncontrols, shall be reported promptly to the Board of Directors following the initial screening \nthereof. All other matters shall be reported at a minimum in summary form to the Board of \nDirectors.  \n \nAll submissions, inquiries and discussions will be documented by the Executive Director (or \nthe Board Chair) and will be kept confidential, specifically in a confidential file. Access to the \nconfidential file shall be restricted to the Board Chair, the Executive Director or the Executive \nDirector’s appointee, and their designated agents. This is important in order to avoid \ndamaging the reputations of persons suspected but subsequently found innocent of \nwrongful conduct and to protect the       from potential civil liability. All such confidential \nfiles shall be maintained for at least seven years following the final disposition of the matter.  \n \nAll other concerns and complaints not relating to the accounting, auditing or reporting of, or \nthe internal controls practices and procedures relating to the      ’s funds shall be handled \npursuant to the current policies and procedures applicable to such matters.  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 41 of 67 \n \nThe       shall take all appropriate steps to prevent retaliation by the      , its directors, \nofficers, employees, volunteers or agents, against any person submitting a complaint on \naccount of that submission. This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable \ndirectors, officers, and employees to raise concerns within the organization for investigation \nand appropriate action. With this goal in mind, no one who, in good faith, reports a concern \nshall be subject to retaliation or, in the case of an employee, adverse employment \nconsequences.  \n \nAny employee or volunteer who is found to have engaged in retaliation contrary to this \npolicy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment (or \nremoval in the case of volunteers.) \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 42 of 67 \n \nPROCUREMENT POLICIES \nIntroduction and Scope  \n \nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that       achieves the best value for goods and \nservices procured, following a transparent and cost effective process.  The policy aims to \nsafeguard an adequate level of competition in order to increase the integrity of the \nprocurement process, ensure good stewardship of funds and meet requirements of funding \nagencies.  \n \nThe following policies and procedures will be followed at all times when       CDC is using \nfederal funds to procure goods and services from an external source. \n \nCDC will follow accounting policies and procedures that comply with generally accepted \naccounting principles (GAAP) and avoid purchasing unnecessary items. Any procur ement of \ngoods and services shall be made by the procurement officer/authorized agent, in the best \ninterest of the CDC, upon considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the \nprocurement, which may include but not limited to price, quality, ava ilability, reputation and \nprior dealings.  \n \nThe Federal regulations pertaining to procurement standards are set forth in 2 CFR Part 200 \n(Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal \nAwards). The standards included in 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.326 must be complied with \nwhen any procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, and services \nmade by       involves the use of Federal funds, including funds directly awarded to       \nby a government agency or department, as well as pass-through federal funds awarded to \n      by local or state agencies (e.g. CDBG awards).  \n      staff is expected to review and comply with the procurement requirements, if any, \nunder the applicable funding source agreement. \n \nCode of Conduct  \nRequirements and Protocol \n2 CFR Section 200.318 requires that      , as a recipient of federal funds, maintain written \nstandards of conduct covering conflict of interests and governing the performance of its \nemployees engaged in the award and administration of contracts.   \nAll       employees who are engaged in the award and administration of government \ncontracts must adhere to a code of professional conduct.  All employees, including those \nemployees who purchase goods or services, or otherwise administer contracts, must follow \nCDC’s      ’s Conflict of Interest Policies. \n \nConflicts of Interest. No employee, officer, or agent of       shall participate in the \nselection, award, or administration of a contract supported by federal funds if a real or \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 43 of 67 \napparent conflict of interest would be involved.  Such a conflict of interest would arise when \nthe employee, officer, or agent of       , any member of his or her immediate family, his or \nher partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties \nindicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm \nconsidered for a contract.   \n \nProhibited Conduct.   No employee, officer, or agent of      must solicit nor accept \ngratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts.  \nFurther, no employee, officer, or agent of       shall accept gratuities, favors, or anything of \nmonetary value (other than an unsolicited gift of a nominal value) from contractors or \nparties to subcontracts.   \n \nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest.  Organizational conflicts of interest means that because \nof relationships with a parent company, affiliate or subsidiary organization, a person or \norganization is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement \naction involving a related organization.        employees responsible for the procurement \nshall identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as early in the \nprocurement process as possible and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential \nconflicts before contract award.  If necessary,      employees are directed to seek counsel \nfrom       in the evaluation of potential organizational conflicts of interest and in \ndeveloping any necessary solicitation provisions and contract clauses.  If it is determined that \na conflict of interest exists and cannot be avoided or mitigated, before determining to \nwithhold an award based on conflict of interest considerations, the       employee \nresponsible for the engagement shall contact the contractor regarding the existence of a \nconflict of interest and provide the contractor with an opportunity to respond.  If the       \nemployee responsible for the engagement determines that it would be in the best interest of \n     to award the contract notwithstanding a conflict of interest, the      employee shall \nrequest a waiver and authorization to proceed from the      . \n \n \nDisciplinary Actions \nAny       employee who violates the requirements and protocol above, may be subject to \ndisciplinary action, based on the seriousness of the violation. \n  \nAcquisition Planning \nPrinciples of Acquisition Planning \n      employees shall make purchase decisions based on necessity and shall avoid \npurchasing unnecessary or duplicative items with       funds.  Consideration should be \ngiven to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase.  \nTo foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with efforts to promote cost-\neffective use of shared services across the Federal government,       may enter into inter-\nentity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common shared goods or \nservices. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 44 of 67 \n \nProcedures and Documentation Requirements \nPrior to purchasing goods or services,       employees shall: \na) Conduct (where appropriate) an analysis of lease and purchase alternatives to \ndetermine the most economical and practical procurement vehicle.  \n Documentation may consist of notes made by the       employee(s) making \nthe purchase decision, estimates/cost projections for lease and purchase \nalternatives (obtained from contractors directly or through reputable Internet \nresources), quotes from contractors, etc. Such       employee(s) should \nconsider (without limitation) the duration of the need for such item, financing \nterms, and the requirements of the applicable funding source. \nb) Show a demonstrated need for all items purchased. \n Documentation may consist of notes made by the       employee(s) making \nthe purchase decision, a copy of the applicable work plan or agreement which \nthe purchase/engagement fulfills, etc. \nc) Review current inventories and goods on order to prevent duplicative purchases. \n Documentation may consist of the inventory record dated on or about the \ndate of the purchase decision. \n       employees are encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property \nin lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is \nfeasible and reduces project costs. \nd) Assess whether the services can be performed more economically by direct \nemployment rather than contracting. \n Documentation may consist of notes made by the       employee(s) making \nthe procurement decision (including cost projections for direct employment \nand contracting).  Such       employee(s) should consider the duration of \nthe need for such services, whether similar services will be required over \ntime, the scope of work, and costs of engagement (as employee and \ncontractor, respectively), among other factors (as the situation might require) \nin his or her assessment.  \ne) When appropriate and applicable, it is recommended that       staff use value \nengineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer \nreasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and \ncreative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is \nprovided at the overall lower cost.   \n  \nRetention of Documentation \n      staff shall maintain documentation in support of his/her observance of the \nrequirements of the section above, for as long as required pursuant to      ’s record \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 45 of 67 \nretention guidelines or as required by the funder pursuant to the applicable funding \nagreement, whichever is later. \n \nSolicitations for Goods and Services \nObjective \nAll procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner providing full and open \ncompetition. Full and open competition in the contracting process should ensure cost \neffectiveness and reduce the potential for favoritism and conflicts of interest (including \norganizational conflicts of interest).  \n \nPrinciples \nBasic Principles of Solicitations.  Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the \nbidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated.   \nSolicitations for goods and services must include the following: \na) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, \nproduct or service to be procured.  The description should not be worded such that it \nunduly restricts competition. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at \nall possible. \nb) All requirements that the offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in \nevaluating bids or proposals (including any specific criteria related to deliverables, \npayment of expenses, payment schedules and timeliness, all of which make up the \ndecision criteria; provided, however, that such specific criteria shall not be unduly \nrestrictive of competition). \nc) The submission deadline and the anticipated award date. \nd) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions \nto be performed and services required, including a range of acceptable characteristics \nor minimum acceptable standards. \ne) When is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the \ntechnical requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description may be used as a \nmeans to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement/that \nbidders are required to meet. The specific features of the named brand which must \nbe met by offers must be clearly stated \n \nSmall and Minority Firms, Businesses, Women’s Business Enterprises, and Labor Surplus Area \nFirms.       employees must take all necessary affirmative steps to assure small and \nminority firms, women’s business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used \nwhenever possible.  Affirmative steps       employees must take, include the following: \na) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises on \nsolicitation lists; \nb) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women’s business enterprises are \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 46 of 67 \nsolicited whenever they are potential sources; \nc) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or \nquantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority businesses, and \nwomen’s business enterprises; \nd) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage \nparticipation by small and minority businesses, and women’s business enterprises; \ne) Using the service and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small \nBusiness Administration and Minority Business Development Agency of the \nDepartment of Commerce; and \nf) Requiring any prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the same \naffirmative steps. \n \nUnfair Competitive Advantage.  In order to ensure objective contractor performance and \neliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, \nrequirements, statements of work, invitation for bids and/or, requests for proposals shall be \nexcluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or \nofferor whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to \n     , price, quality and other factors considered. Some of the situations considered to be \nrestrictive of competition include but are not limited to: \na) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do \nbusiness; \nb) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding; \nc) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies; \nd) Noncompetitive contracts to contractors that are on retainer contracts; \ne) Organizational conflicts of interest; \nf) Specifying only a ‘‘brand name’’ product instead of allowing ‘‘an equal’’ product to be \noffered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the \nprocurement; and \ng) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. \n \nMonitoring Contractors’ Practices.        shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest \nas well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate \ncompetition. \n \nProhibited Use of Geographical Preferences.       staff shall conduct procurement in a \nmanner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state or local \ngeographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where \napplicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing \nin this section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and \nengineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 47 of 67 \napplication leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the \nproject, to compete for the contract. \n \nPrequalified Lists of Persons, Firms or Products.       shall ensure that all prequalified lists \nof persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and \ninclude enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition.       \nshall not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during applicable solicitation periods.  \n \nProcurement Methods (Types of Solicitations) \n      employees must use ONE of the following methods of procurement, for each instance \nof procurement: \nProcurement by Micro-Purchases. Contracts up to $3,000 \nProcurement by Small Purchase Procedures. Contracts from $3,001 to $[Not to exceed \n$150,000 (2 CFR 200.88)].  \nProcurement by Competitive Proposals. Contracts in excess of $     . \nProcurement by Sealed Bids - Construction. \nProcurement by Noncompetitive Proposals. \n \nProcurement by Micro-Purchases. Procurement by micro-purchase is the acquisition of \nsupplies or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed $3,000 (or \n$2,000 in the case of acquisitions for construction subject to the Davis-Bacon Act). To the \nextent practicable,       shall distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified \nsuppliers. Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotations if \n      considers the price to be reasonable. \n \nProcurement by Small Purchase Procedures. Contracts from $3,001 to $[Not to exceed \n$150,000 (2 CFR 200.88)]. \n \nSmall purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods \nfor securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the Simplified \nAcquisition Threshold ($     ). If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate \nquotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources, not less than \nthree (3).  \n \nMay be solicited verbally; however price and rate quotes obtained verbally must be \nconfirmed in writing, via email, facsimile, or other acceptable documentation.  Moreover, \nthe staff responsible for the engagement and oversight of the contractor shall maintain \ndocumentation of its solicitation and engagement process. \n \n**Tip:  Requests for Proposals might be recommended for certain procurement transactions, \nparticularly where a significant award is contemplated or where the services are of a complex \nnature – in order to ensure that potential contractors are all being providing with the same \ninformation. \na) Price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 48 of 67 \nsources, not less than three (3).   \nb)       employee(s) may contact persons and firms included on lists of prequalified \ncontractors.  \nc) “Qualified” means the supplier/contractor is able to meet required licensing or \ncertification requirements, is not prohibited from participating in the procurement \naction, and can fulfill      ’s requirements.  \nd)       employee(s) responsible for the initiation of the solicitation and selection of \nthe contractor shall document its decision rationale in its file.  The documentation \nmust include the performance requirements and the organizations/individuals that \nwere contacted.  Specifically, the documentation should include, but not be limited \nto: \n The name of the individual soliciting the information;  \n The names of the companies/individuals solicited and the individuals \nproviding the price or rate quotation;  \n The date the information was provided;  \n The goods or services to be purchased, including the quantities upon \nwhich the price or rate quote was provided;  \n All pertinent terms or conditions imposed by either party; \n The duration of the price or rate quotation. A new solicitation must be \nconducted for purchases that will be made after the current quotation \nexpires; and \n Responsiveness of the bid/quotations to the selection criteria \ncontained in the solicitation (including comparative analysis of the \nbidding individuals/companies). \n  \n**Tip:  Requests for Proposals might best accomplish this for certain procurement \ntransactions, particularly where a significant award is contemplated or where the services \nare of a complex nature. \n \nWhen a proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the \ncontract amount by more than the amount of the simplified acquisition threshold, the \nprotocol on procurement by competitive proposal shall be followed.  \n \nProcurement by Competitive Proposals. Contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition \nThreshold- $       \nThe technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source \nsubmitting an offer, and either a fixed price or cost reimbursement type contract is awarded. \nIt is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this \nmethod is used, the following requirements apply:  \na) Requests for proposals (“RFPs”) must be publicized and identify all evaluation factors \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 49 of 67 \nand their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals \nmust be considered to the maximum extent practical; \nb) Proposals must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources; written \nresponses must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources, not less \nthan two for any RFP.  It is strongly recommended that at least three (3) price or rate \nquotations be obtained for each RFP to strengthen the price analysis for the \nprocurement action; \nc) “Qualified” means the supplier is able to meet required licensing or certification \nrequirements, is not prohibited from participating in the procurement action, and can \nfulfill      ’s requirements.  \nd)       must have a written method for conducting technical evaluations of the \nproposals received and for selecting recipients;  \ne) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal is most \nadvantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and \n \nIf needed/applicable,       may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-\nbased procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby \ncompetitors’ qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, \nsubject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not \nused as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It \ncannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source \nto perform the proposed effort.  \n \nContracts in Excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold: \nMust be solicited utilizing written Request for Proposals (RFPs) \nMinimum Components: \na) All of the requirements for solicitations under section above. \nb) Any contract requirements mandated by the applicable funder. \nc) Written Requests for Proposals may be posted on or printed in (as applicable): \nd)       website \n Local chamber of commerce \n Idealist.org \n Local or national (as feasible or necessary) newspapers \n Trade or industry newsletters, journals, or periodicals \n  \n**Tip:  Objective is to elicit an adequate number of responses from qualified bidders.  The \n      employee(s) should be able to defend that the selected medium/media fosters open \nand free competition.  \nTip:  It may be a good practice to post or print Requests for Proposals on a public forum, \neven if prequalified contractors have been identified through a Request for Qualifications \nprocess, to further ensure maximum open and free competition.  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 50 of 67 \nResponses to the Requests for Proposals must be in writing.  \nProgram staff shall regularly monitor and evaluate the contractor’s performance against the \nagreed-upon specifications, milestones, or scope of work and promptly address deficiencies.  \nProgram staff shall maintain records of its monitoring and evaluation activities with respect \nto the contractor in accordance with requisite record retention policies. \n \nProcurement by Sealed Bids - Construction (Formal Advertising). Bids are publicly solicited \nand a firm fixed price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder \nwhose bid, conforming with all of the material terms and conditions of the invitation for \nbids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring \nconstruction, if the following conditions apply. In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the \nfollowing conditions should be present:  \na) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; \nb) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the \nbusiness; and \nc) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the \nsuccessful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price. \n \nIf sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply: \n \na) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids must be solicited from an \nadequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient response time prior \nto the date set for opening the bids; \nb) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent \nattachments, must define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly \nrespond; \nc) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for \nbids; \nd) A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and \nresponsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents factors such as discounts, \ntransportation cost, and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid \nis lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior \nexperience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and \ne) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason. \n \nProcurement by Noncompetitive Proposals. Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is \nprocurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source and may be used only \nwhen one or more of the following circumstances apply: \na) The item is available only from a single source; \nb) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay \nresulting from competitive solicitation; \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 51 of 67 \nc) The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes \nnoncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the non-Federal \nentity; or \nd) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. \n \nProcurement Instruments (Type of Contract) \nObjective \nThe type of procuring instruments used shall be appropriate for the particular procurement \nand for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. \n \nProcedures \n      will determine the type of procuring instruments in order to ensure that goods and \nservices are obtained in the most efficient, cost effective manner, without barriers to full and \nopen competition and free of any potential conflicts of interest  \nGovernment awarding agencies may impose limitations on contractor compensation.       \nstaff procuring contractors with government funds should familiarize themselves with \nspecific contract requirements, including those imposing maximum hourly or daily rates of \ncompensation for contractors. In such cases,       strongly prefers to enter into deliverable-\nbased or fix price contracts. \n \nProcurement Instruments \nDeliverables-Based or Fixed Price Contracts:  Contractors will be engaged to perform specific \nand discrete tasks and/or create specific deliverables and will be paid a flat fee upon \ncompletion of each specific/discrete task and/or delivery of each satisfactory final \ndeliverable. \na) Responsive bids will include flat fee for the applicable task(s) and/or deliverable(s) \nand projected expenses for which the contractor will seek reimbursement for from \n       (which shall be reimbursed at actual cost). \nb) Fees do not fluctuate based on time spent by the contractor to complete the work. \n**Tip:  The fees quoted by the contractor should nevertheless be “reasonable”.  The \nreasonableness of the fee may be determined by a comparison of the responding contractors’ \nfees for the requested task(s) and/or deliverable(s), and an evaluation of the fees charged by \nthe contractor historically for similar tasks and/or deliverables. \n \nTime-Based (Hourly/Daily Rate) Contracts:  Contractors will be engaged to perform specific \ntasks and will be paid based on time spent by the contractor to complete the work. \na) Time-Based Contracts should only be used after a determination has been made that \nno other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the \ncontractor exceeds at its own risk. \nb) Responsive bids should also include projected expenses for which the contractor will \nseek reimbursement for from        (which shall be reimbursed at actual cost).  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 52 of 67 \nc) The contract shall be subject to a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own \nrisk. \nd) Rates shall not fluctuate once a contract is awarded. \ne) Projected time shall not fluctuate without significant extenuating circumstances. \n \n      employees awarding such time-based contracts must assert a high degree of oversight \nin order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and \neffective cost controls. \n \n**Tip:  Since time-based contracts can generate an open-ended contract price, which \nprovides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency, such \ncontracts must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. \nResponsive bids will include a rate based on time (hourly/daily) and the projected number of \nhours/days (depending on the rate increment charged by the contractor) to complete the \nscope of work. \n \n \nOther Procurement Instruments:  If a different procurement instrument is contemplated for \nuse, staff should contact       for guidance prior to issuance of solicitations. \na) Neither “cost-plus-a percentage-of-cost” nor “percentage of construction cost” \nmethods of contracting shall be used.  \nb) Time and material type contracts may only be used after a determination has been \nmade that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that \nthe contractor exceeds at its own risk.  Time and material type contract means a \ncontract whose cost is the sum of (i) the actual cost of materials; (ii) direct labor \nhours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative \nexpenses, and profit.        employees awarding such time-based contracts must \nassert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the \ncontractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls. \n \nAdditional Considerations for Procurement of Office Supplies and Equipment  \nThe procedures outlined below are in addition to      ’s procurement procedures \nestablished in Accounting and Finance Policy Manual and the      Manual.       staff \nshould also be guided by this document and 2 CFR Sections 200.453 and 200.439, as \napplicable. \n \nPlease be aware that federal disposition requirements apply for equipment purchases in \nexcess of $5,000, with government funds. Equipment means tangible personal property \n(including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a \nper-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds $5,000.  \n \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 53 of 67 \nOffice Supplies. Office supplies are small items used in the office to maintain daily \nfunctionality (e.g. writing implements, paper products, office calculators, extensions cords, \nstaplers, etc.).  Examples of large items not included in this definition are office equipment \nand furniture. \nApproved Vendor:       is      ’s only vendor for office supplies (effective      ). \nPayment for approved office supplies orders will be processed through     .  \n \nSoftware, Hardware (including computers) and General Office Equipment are purchases and \nleases of general office equipment and computer software, hardware and any computer-\nrelated equipment that is to be used by       CDC staff for       CDC business purposes. \nNo software, hardware, or general office equipment should be purchased without first \nreceiving the appropriate approval from       and it must be compatible with       \nsystems and/or meet corporate standards. This will be determined by      . \n \nPurchased with Government Funds:  Office supplies, software, hardware and general office \nequipment to be used by       staff for       business purposes and charged to \ngovernment funding sources will be subject to the test of allowability, allocability and \nreasonableness, in accordance with the principles established by  2 CFR Part 200. The \nfollowing parameters shall be used to make this determination:  \na) Whether the cost is a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the \norganization or the performance of the award.   \nb) Whether the cost is incurred through an “arm’s length transaction,” and do not \ndeviate from established practices of the organization. \nc) Whether the cost does not exceed, in nature or amount that which would be incurred \nby a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was \nmade to incur the costs. \nd) Whether the cost is consistently charged to both government and non-governmental \n(private) programs.   \ne) The cost is incurred specifically for the award. \nf) The cost benefits both the award and other work and can be distributed in \nreasonable proportion to the benefits received. \ng) The cost is necessary to the overall operation of the organization, although a direct \nrelationship to any particular cost objective cannot be shown.  \nh) Any cost allocable to a particular award or other cost objective under these principles \nmay not be shifted to other awards to overcome funding deficiencies, or to avoid \nrestrictions imposed by law or by the terms of the award. \ni) The cost is allowable according to 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart E.  \nj) Hardware (including computers) and software and general office equipment \npurchases to be made by      as part of a government contract and to be used by \nanother party for programmatic purposes require the participation and approval of \n      Department which will work with the program responsible for initiating the \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 54 of 67 \nprocurement process in order to identify hardware and software requirements, \ndevelop technical specifications for vendors, request at least three (3) quotes from \nvendors and participate in the negotiation process, as described above.  \n \nContract Cost and Price and Other Selection Criteria \n \nRequirement \n      shall perform a cost or price analysis (and document such analysis in the procurement \nfiles) in connection with every procurement action in excess of the Simplified Acquisition \nThreshold, including contract modifications.  \n \nContracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability \nto perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. \nConsideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past \nperformance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. \nIn certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' \nimplementation of Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.” \n \n      Procedures \nAwards should be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the \nsolicitation and is most advantageous to      , price, quality and other factors considered.  \n      reserves the right to reject any and all bid offers, if deemed to be in      ’s best \ninterest. \n      shall enter into contracts only with responsible contractors who possess the potential \nability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement.  \nConsideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity; record of past \nperformance; financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. \nThe method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular \nprocurement situation, but as a starting point,       must make independent estimates \nbefore receiving bids or proposals. \nOffers and proposals received by       shall be evaluated according to the following \nparameters: \n \nContract Cost and Price.  The       employee responsible for the procurement action shall \nperform a cost or price analysis with every procurement e made by in excess of the \nSimplified Acquisition Threshold, including contract modifications. This analysis shall be \ndocumented , and supplemented by other supporting documentation maintained by such \n     employee, for all government funded actions.  Modifications that change the work \nbeyond the scope of the contract must be justified, and may require additional competitive \nbidding.  \nPrice Analysis:    A comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar \nindicia, together with discounts.  It is the evaluation of the proposed price (i.e. lump sum) \nwithout analyzing any of the separate cost elements that comprise the proposed price.  \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 55 of 67 \n      shall compare an offeror’s price to others, previous prices paid for similar services, \ncatalogue prices or other similar data. \n \n \n**Tip: When to Use:  Whenever you are comparing lump sum prices (not cost estimates). \nCompetition: Compare two or more responsible (not debarred or suspended, etc.), \ncompeting independently.  The greater the number of offers/bids, the greater the \ncompetition and the better the pricing. \nCost Analysis:    A review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine \nreasonableness, allocability and allowability. Cost analysis is done when offers are broken \ninto various elements of cost (i.e.: training services broken by fees, travel, materials, etc).  \n     shall analyze the costs associated with the offer and determine the reasonableness of \nthe amounts (by each component) included in the total cost and the necessity of each \nelement of cost.  \n \n**Tip. When to Use:  Whenever you do not have price competition – \n \nNon-Competitive (or Negotiated) Proposal:  Acquiring professional, consulting, \narchitect/engineering services, where bidders are required to submit cost proposals that \nshow the elements (labor, materials, overhead, profit, etc.). \n \nSole Source:  Not soliciting competitive bids or offers. Sole source selection must be \nappropriate and justified.  Used when award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase \nprocedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following applies: (i) the \nitem/service is available only from a single source; (ii) the exigency/emergency for the \nrequirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation; (iii) the awarding \nagency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or (iv) after solicitation of a number of sources, \ncompetition is determined inadequate. \n \n**Tip: Note:  Sole source justification is available in limited circumstances and may require \nconsultation with the applicable government funder.  If justification is available, all \ndocumentation in support of such position must be maintained by the local or National office \nresponsible for the engagement. \n \nOnly One Bid Received and Bid Differs Substantially from Independent Estimate of the \nContract Price:  If you determine that the bid is unreasonable and decide to not recomplete \n(market survey tells you that you will not get competition), then you may formally cancel the \nsolicitation and negotiate a contract price with the single bidder. You must obtain a cost \nbreakdown of the contractor’s proposed cost – not a lump sum proposal – before \nnegotiating the change in contract price. \n \nModifications to a Contract:  If modification changes the work authorized under the contract, \nand changes the price or total estimated cost, either upwards or downwards, you must \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 56 of 67 \nobtain a detailed breakdown of the contractor’s proposed cost – not a lump sum proposal – \nbefore negotiating the change in contract price. \nCost Analysis and Fees:  The non-Federal entity must negotiate profit as a separate element \nof the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where \ncost analysis is performed.  To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be \ngiven to: \n \na) The complexity of the work to be performed (the more difficult the work, the more \nprofit a contractor may be entitled to); \nb) The risk borne by the contractor (the higher the risk, the higher the profit/fee); \nc) Contractor’s investment (labor, oversight, etc.) (the greater the investment of \nresources, the higher the profit/fee); \nd) Subcontracting (the more complex the contract, the higher the profit/fee); \ne) Quality of the contractor’s past performance (profit/fee rewards contractor for \nproven record of high quality performance); and \nf) Industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical areas for similar work (“going \nrate”) – Be careful to not pay going rates when the work required is not really \ncovered by those rates (you should not pay specialty rates for routine work). \ng) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are \nallowable only to the  extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in \nnegotiated prices would be allowable for the non-Federal entity under Subpart E—\nCost Principles of this Part. The non-Federal entity may reference its own cost \nprinciples that comply with the Federal cost principles. \n \nThe cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of \ncontracting must not be used. \n \nFederal Debarment Standard \nWhen purchasing goods and services using federal funding,       employees must ensure \nthat the contract awardee is not debarred or suspended from doing business with the \nfederal government nor delinquent in a debt to the United States.  Before a contract is \nawarded, the       employee responsible for such procurement should check the System \nfor Award Management (“SAM”) and verify that the contractor is not so debarred or \nsuspended from doing business with the federal government and that the contractor does \nnot have any active exclusions in SAM.   \n \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  \nWhen purchasing goods and services using government funding,       shall comply with \nOFAC’s regulations against doing business with targeted terrorists and other criminals. Prior \nto entering into an agreement,       will use a web-based watch list screening tool to \nensure compliance with this requirement. \n \nSample Policies and Procedures Manual v 2.1 \nPage 57 of 67 \n \nContractor Monitoring \nMonitoring Performance.   \nProgram staff shall regularly monitor and evaluate the contractor’s performance against \nagreed-upon specifications, milestones, or scope of work and promptly address deficiencies.  \nProgram staff shall maintain records of its monitoring and evaluation activities with respect \nto the contractor in accordance with requisite record retention policies. \n \nProcurement Records \nRequirement \n      staff must maintain procurement records sufficient to detail the history of a \nprocurement action.  These records shall include the following at a minimum:  \na) Rationale for the method of procurement \nb) Selection of contract type \nc) Contactor selection or rejection; and \nd) Basis for contract price. \n \nSolicitation Documentation \n      must maintain   procurement   records   in connection with every procurement action.   \nSolicitation Documentation: Staff shall maintain information used to solicit and select a \ncontractor, in addition to information documenting the actual purchases made from the \nsuccessful contractor. This information may include:  \na) Copies of solicitation documents;  \nb) Names and dates of contractors contacted by phone;  \nc) Copies of letters, e-mails and faxes soliciting price or rate quotations;  \nd) Trip reports identifying contractors contacted in person;  \ne) Copies of price or rate quotations received, including telephone quote confirmations;  \nf) Notification to the successful contractor;   \ng) Purchase documents, such as invoices, bills of lading and canceled checks; and \nh) Such other documentation as recommended elsewhere in this document. \n \nFederal Agency Reviews.   \nOn request,      shall provide the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity with \ntechnical specifications on proposed procurements should the awarding agency or pass-\nthrough entity believes such review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is \nthe one being proposed for acquisition. This review generally will take place prior to the time \nthe specification is incorporated into a solicitation document.
